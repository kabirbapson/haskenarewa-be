      The vulture is a patient bird by James Hadley Chase - Chapter one his
      built-in instinct for danger brought fennel instantly awake. He raised his
      head from the pillow and listened. Black darkness surrounded him: the
      darkness of the blind. Listening, he could hear the gentle slap-slap of
      water against the side of the moored barge. He could hear mimi's light
      breathing. There was also a slight rhythmic creaking as the barge heaved
      in the swell of the river. He could also hear rain falling lightly on the
      upper deck. All these sounds were reassuring. So why then, he asked
      himself, had he come so abruptly awake? For the past month he had lived
      under the constant threat of death, and his instincts had sharpened.
      Danger was near: he felt it. He imagined he could even smell it. Silently,
      he reached down and groped under the bed until his fingers closed around
      the handle of a police baton. Attached to the end of the baton was a short
      length of bicycle chain. This chain turned the baton into a deadly,
      vicious weapon. Gently, so as not to disturb the sleeping woman at his
      side, fennel raised the sheet and blanket and slid out of bed. He was
      always meticulously careful to place his clothes on a chair by the bed: no
      matter where he stayed. To find his clothes, to dress quickly in the dark
      was vitally important when living under the threat of death. He slid into
      his trousers and into rubber soled shoes. The woman in the bed moaned
      softly and turned over. Holding the flail in his right hand, he moved
      silently to the door. He had learned the geography of the barge and the
      solid darkness didn't bother him. He found the well greased bolt and drew
      it back, then his fingers found the door handle and turned it. Gently, he
      eased open the door a few inches. He peered out into the rain and
      darkness. The slapping sound of water against the side of the barge, the
      increased sound of the rain blotted out all other sounds, but this didn't
      deceive fennel. There was danger out there in the darkness. He could feel
      the shorthairs on the nape of his neck bristling. Cautiously, he opened
      the door wider so that he could see the full length of the deck faintly
      outlined by the street lights of the embankment. To his left, he could see
      the glow of light from london's west-end. Again he listened; again he
      heardsee the glow of light from london's west-end. Again he listened;
      again he heard nothing to alarm him. But the danger was there . . . He was
      sure of it. He crouched, lay flat and slid out on to the cold, wet deck.
      Rain pattered down on his naked, powerful shoulders. He edged forward,
      then his lips came off his even white teeth in a snarl. Some fifty metres
      from the moored barge, he could see a rowing boat drifting towards him.
      There were four powerfully built men crouching in the boat. He could see
      the outline of their heads and their shoulders against the glow of the
      distant lights. One of the men was using an oar to direct the boat towards
      the barge: his movements were careful and silent. Fennel slid further on
      to the deck. His fingers tightened on the handle of the flail. He waited.
      It would be wrong to describe fennel as courageous as it would be wrong to
      describe a leopard as courageous. The leopard will run when it can, but
      when cornered, it becomes one of the most dangerous and vicious of all
      jungle beasts. Fennel was like the leopard. If he saw a way out, he ran,
      but if he were trapped, he turned into a nerveless animal determined only
      . . . No matter the means . . . On self preservation. Fennel had known
      sooner or later they would find him. Well, they were here, drifting
      silently towards him. Their approach left him only with a vicious
      determination to protect himself. He was not frightened. He had been
      purged of fear once he knew for certain that moroni had decreed that he
      should die. He watched the boat as it drifted closer. They knew he was
      dangerous, and they were taking no risks. They wanted to get aboard, make
      a quick dash down into the bedroom and then the four of them would smother
      him while their knives carved him. He waited, feeling the rain cold on his
      naked shoulders. The man with the oar dipped the blade and made a gentle
      stroke. The boat heaved over the wind-swept water at a faster rate. Fennel
      was invisible in the shadows. He decided he had judged his position
      accurately. They would board the barge about four metres from where he was
      lying. The rower shipped the oar and laid it gently as if it were made of
      spun sugar along the three seats of the boat. He now had enough way to
      bring the boat to the side of the barge. Side of the barge. The man
      sitting on the front seat stood up and leaned forward. He eased the boat
      against the side of the barge, then with an athletic spring, he came
      aboard. He turned and caught the hand of the second man who moved forward.
      As he was helping him on to the deck, fennel made his move. He rose up out
      of the darkness, slid across the slippery deck and slashed with the flail.
      The chain caught the first man across his face. He gave a wild yell,
      staggered, then pitched into the river. The second man, his reflexes
      swift, spun around, knife in hand to face fennel, but the chain slashed
      him around the neck, tearing his skin and sending him reeling back. He
      clutched at nothing, then went into the water, flat on his back. Fennel
      darted into the shadows. His grin was vicious and evil. He knew the other
      two men in the boat couldn't see him. The light was behind them. There was
      a moment of confusion. Then frantically, the man who had used the oar,
      grabbed it and began to pull away from the barge. The other man was trying
      to get his companions out of the river into the boat. Fennel lay watching.
      His heart was hammering, and his breathing came in jerky snorts through
      his wide nostrils. The two men were dragged aboard. The rower had the
      second oar now in the rowlock and was pulling away from the barge. Fennel
      remained where he was. If they saw him, they might risk a shot. He waited,
      shivering in the cold, until the boat disappeared into the darkness, then
      he got to his feet. He leaned over the side of the barge to wash the blood
      off the chain. He felt the icy rain sliding down inside his trousers. He
      thought they might come back later, and if they did, the odds would be
      stacked against him. They would no longer be taken by surprise. He shook
      the rain out of his eyes. He must get out, and get out fast. He went down
      the eight steps into the big living and bedroom and flicked on thehe went
      down the eight steps into the big living and bedroom and flicked on the
      light. The woman in bed sat up. "what is it, lew? " he paid no attention
      to her. He stripped off his sodden trousers and walked naked into the
      small bathroom. God! He was cold! He turned on the hot shower tap, waited
      a moment, then stepped under the healing hot spray. Mimi came into the
      bathroom. Her eyes were drugged with sleep, her long black hair touselled,
      her big breasts escaping from her nightdress. "lew! What is it? " fennel
      ignored her. He stood, thick, massive and short, under the hot spray of
      water, letting the water soak the thick hairs on his chest, belly and
      loins. "lew! " he waved her away, then turned off the shower and took up a
      towel. But she wouldn't go away. She stood outside the bathroom, staring
      at him, her green, dark ringed eyes alight with fear. "get me a shirt . .
      . Don't stand there like a goddam dummy! " he threw aside the towel. "what
      happened? I want to know. Lew! What's going on? " he pushed past her and
      walked into the inner room. He jerked open the closet door, found a shirt
      and struggled into it, found a pair of trousers and slid into them. He
      pulled on a black turtle neck sweater, then shrugged himself into a black
      jacket with leather patches on the elbows. His movements were swift and
      final. She stood in the doorway, watching. "why don't you say something?
      Her voice was shrill. "what's happening? ""why don't you say something?
      Her voice was shrill. "what's happening? " he paused for a brief moment to
      look at her and he grimaced. Well, she had been convenient, he told
      himself, but no man in his right mind could call her an oil painting.
      Still, she had provided him with a hideout on this crummy barge for the
      past four weeks. Right now, without her plaster of make-up, she looked
      like hell. She was too fat. Those sagging breasts sickened him. Her
      anxious terror aged her. What was she . . . Forty? But she had been
      convenient. It had taken moroni four weeks to find him, but now it was
      time to leave. In three hours, fennel thought, probably less, she would
      not even be a memory to him. "a little trouble, " he said. "nothing. Don't
      get excited. Go back to bed. " she moved into the room. The barge lifted
      slightly as the wind moved the river. "why are you dressing? What were you
      . . . " just shut up, will you? I'm leaving. " her face sagged. "leaving?
      Why? Where are you going? " he took a cigarette from the box on the table.
      He was feeling fine now after the hot shower and more assured, but he knew
      she was going to be a nuisance. She was horribly possessive. She needed
      his brutal love-making . . . The reason why she had kept him there. She
      wasn't going to be shaken off easily. "get into bed, " he said. "you'll
      catch cold. " thinking: as if i give a damn. "i have a phone call to make.
      " she knew he was lying and she grabbed hold of his arm. "you can't leave
      me! I've done everything for you. You're not to go! " "for god's sake,
      shut up! " fennel snarled and shoving her aside, he crossed the room to
      the telephone. As he dialled the number, he looked at his wrist-watch. The
      time was 03.50 hrs. He waited, listening to the steady burr-burr-burr of
      the ringing tone. There was a click and a sleepy voice demanded, "w'o the
      "ell is this? " "jacey? This is lew. " "gawd! I was asleep! ""this earns
      you twenty nicker, " fennel said, speaking slowly and distinctly. "get
      your car. Meet me at the crown pub, king's road in twenty minutes, and i
      mean twenty minutes. " "you crackers? Look at the time! W'ot's up? I'm not
      coming out. It's raining fit to drown a duck. " "twenty nickers . . .
      Twenty minutes, " fennel said quietly. There was a long pause. He could
      hear jacey breathing heavily and imagined he could hear his greedy brain
      creaking. "the crown? " "yes. " "the things i do! Well, okay. I'm on my
      way. " fennel replaced the receiver. "you're not leaving! " mimi's face
      blotched with red and her eyes were glaring. "i won't let you leave! " he
      ignored her and went swiftly to the dressing-table, jerked open a drawer
      and snatched up the essential articles he always kept there: a safety
      razor, a tube of brushless cream, a toothbrush, threepacks of players
      cigarettes and a haircomb. These he stowed away in his jacket pocket. She
      again grabbed hold of his arm. "i've done everything for you! " she
      wailed. "you blasted jailbird! Without me, you would have starved! " he
      shoved her away and crossed the room to the mantelpiece that framed a
      phony fireplace in which stood an electric stove. He took down a big
      chinese teapot. The moment he touched it, she sprang forward and tried to
      take the teapot from him. Her eyes were wild, her long black hair hung
      over her face making her look like a demented witch. "take your hands off
      that! " she screamed. The flickering evil in his washed out grey eyes
      should have warned her, but she was too frantic to stop him taking her
      savings to be warned. Was too frantic to stop him taking her savings to be
      warned. "take it easy, mimi; he said. "i have to have it. I'll let you
      have it back . . . Promise. " "no! " she hooked her fingers and slashed at
      his face as her left hand wrenched at the teapot. Fennel jerked his head
      back, released the teapot and then savagely struck her on the side of the
      jaw. The force of the blow flung her backwards. She fell, her eyes rolling
      up and her head thudding on the floor. The teapot smashed to pieces as her
      grip was released and money spewed from it. Fennel poked aside the pile of
      silver and picked up the small roll of ten pound notes. He didn't look at
      the unconscious woman. He put the money in his hip pocket, picked up his
      flail and went up on deck. As far as he was concerned his thirty days with
      mimi were chalk marks on the blackboard now erased. Rain was falling
      heavily, and the wind felt bleak against his face. He stood for some
      seconds looking at the embankment, letting his eyes become accustomed to
      the darkness. Nothing moved. Hewould have to take a chance, he thought,
      and ran the landing plank, from the barge, down to the wet tarmac. He slid
      down the plank, gained the dark shadows and again paused to listen. Again
      he heard nothing to alarm him. His fingers tightened on the flail and
      keeping close to the embankment wall, he walked silently to the distant
      steps that led to the upper embankment. If jacey was late, he could be
      sunk, he thought. They would have to stop the bleeding: the one who had
      been hit on the neck would bleed like a stuck pig. Then they would
      telephone moroni and report failure. Moroni would get four or five men
      down there fast. Fennel decided he had a possible half-hour of freedom:
      certainly not more. But he had no need to worry. As he reached the
      darkened crown public house, he saw jacey's battered morris pull up. He
      sprinted across the road, opened the car door and slid in. "back to your
      place, jacey. " "wait a mo', " jacey said. The street light lit up his
      aged, rat face. "w'ot's on the"wait a mo', " jacey said. The street light
      lit up his aged, rat face. "w'ot's on the move? " fennel gripped jacey's
      thin wrist. "back to your place! " he snarled. Jacey caught a glimpse of
      the vicious twist of the mouth and the half mad expression of contained
      rage. He grunted, engaged gear and set the morris in motion. Ten minutes
      later, the two men were in a small, shabbily furnished room, lit by a
      dusty, shadeless lamp that hung precariously from the dirty ceiling. Jacey
      put a bottle of black & white on the table and two glasses. He poured two
      stiff drinks and cradled his glass in his dirty hands while he regarded
      fennel uneasily. Jacey was a bookie's clerk and did any odd job for the
      lesser tearaways to earn extra money. He knew fennel to be a major
      tearaway. He had met him in parkhurst jail when they were serving
      sentences: fennel for robbery with violence: jacey for trying to pass
      badly forged ten shilling notes. When they had been released, they had
      kept in touch and jacey had been flattered to have a big man like fennel
      interested in him. But now he was sorry he had had anything to do with
      fennel. He had heard through the underworld grapevine that fennel had
      talked and five of moroni's men had walked into a police trap. He knew
      moroni had put the death sign on fennel, but he was too greedy to pass up
      the chance of earning twenty pounds. Fennel took out mimi's roll of ten
      pound notes. He pulled off two and tossed them on the table. "freeze on to
      those, jacey, " he said. "i'm staying here for a couple of days. " jacey's
      ferret-like eyes widened. He didn't touch the money on the table. "can't
      "ave you "ere for two days, lew. Ain't safe. They'll carve me if they find
      out you've been "ere. " "i can carve you too, " fennel said softly. "and
      i'm here. ""i can carve you too, " fennel said softly. "and i'm here. "
      jacey scratched his unshaven chin. His eyes darted about the room while he
      considered the situation and the risks. Moroni was probably in bed,
      asleep, but fennel was here. Fennel could be as dangerous as moroni.
      "okay, then . . . Two days . . . Not an "our more, " he said finally. "in
      two days, i'll be out of the country, " fennel said. "i've got a job.
      Maybe, i won't be coming back. " he finished his whisky and then walked
      into the inner room and over to the battered couch that served jacey as a
      bed. He kicked off his shoes and lay down. "you sleep on the floor, and
      turn that goddamn light off. " "go a'ead, " jacey said bitterly. "make
      yourself at "ome. " he reached up and turned off the light. A week
      previously, garry edwards had seen in the daily telegraph the following
      advertisement: experienced helicopter pilot required for a three week
      unusual assignment. Exceptionally high remuneration. Send career details
      and photograph. Box s. 1012. He had re-read the advertisement and had
      brooded over it. He liked the two words unusual and exceptional. He was
      looking for unusual work and badly needed exceptional money, so without
      telling toni, he had written a letter to box s.1012, setting out the
      details of his past career which was as full of lies as a colander is full
      of holes. He had enclosed a passport photograph and had mailed the letter.
      A week had passed, and he now had given up all hope of any exceptional
      remuneration and any unusual job. On this cold, wet february morning, he
      sat in toni's small, untidy sitting-room with a cup of nescafe by his side
      while he searched the situations vacant columns in the daily telegraph.
      Garry edwards was a tall, powerfully-built man of twenty-nine years of
      age. He was handsome in a rugged way, with humorous brown eyes and
      dark-brown hair worn fashionably long to his collar. His mouth could laugh
      easily or tighten to a dangerous thinness. As he sat on toni's broken down
      settee, dressed, in a white beach wrap, his long narrow feet bare, the
      wall clock showed the time was 08.45 hrs. Having searched the situations
      vacant columns carefully, he dropped thehaving searched the situations
      vacant columns carefully, he dropped the newspaper to the floor in
      disgust. Well, he would have to do something pretty soon, he told himself.
      He had exactly one hundred and thirty pounds, five shillings and seven
      pence before he had to ask toni to support him, and this, he told himself
      without much conviction, he would never do. He had run into toni white on
      the calaisdover channel boat. Happily, she had been in the bar when he had
      embarked with two tough-looking french detectives who remained with him
      until the vessel was about to sail. When they had gone, and after garry
      had waved cheerfully to them as they stood on the rain-swept quay to see
      the vessel leave the harbour a wave they had stonily ignored he had gone
      down to the first class bar for his first drink in three years. Toni had
      been sitting on a bar stool, her micro-mini skirt scarcely covering her
      crotch, sipping a cinzano bitter on the rocks. He had ordered a double vat
      69 with a dash and then had saluted her. She seemed the kind of girl a man
      could salute if the man had a way with him, and garry certainly had a way
      with him. Toni was twenty-two years of age, blonde, elfin-like with big
      blue eyes with dark, heavy eyelashes a cow would envy. Also, she was very,
      very chic. She regarded garry thoughtfully and with penetration. She
      decided he was the most sexy-looking man she had ever seen, and she had a
      hot rush of blood through her body. She wanted to have him: to be laid by
      him as she had never been laid before in her short, sensual life. She
      smiled. Garry knew women. He knew all the signs, and realized that here
      was an invitation that needed little or no finesse. He had in his wallet
      the sum of two hundred and ninety pounds: what remained of the sale of his
      aircraft before the french police had caught up with him. He was full of
      confidence and raring to go. He finished his drink, then smiling, he said,
      "i would love to know you better. We have over an hour before we land. May
      i get a cabin? " she liked his direct approach. She wanted him. His
      suggestion made everything simple. She laughed, then nodded. It was easy
      to get a cabin, draw the curtains and lock themselves in. The steward had
      to rap a dozen times to remind them they had reached dover and if theyhad
      to rap a dozen times to remind them they had reached dover and if they
      didn't make haste, they would miss the boat train. While sitting by his
      side in an otherwise empty first classcompartment on their way to london,
      toni had told him she was a successful model, had plenty of work, had a
      two room apartment in chelsea and if he wanted a roof . . . "well,
      honey-love, why not move in? " garry had been planning on a cheap room in
      some modest hotel off the cromwell road until he could take stock and find
      himself lucrative employment. He didn't hesitate. He had been living now
      with toni for some three weeks, spending his remaining capital but not
      finding any lucrative employment. Now, with no prospects, he was getting
      slightly anxious. Toni, however, thought it all a huge joke. "why worry,
      you big gorgeous animal? " she had demanded the previous evening, jumping
      on to his lap and nibbling his ear. "i have all the money in the world!
      Let's make hectic love! " garry finished his half-cold coffee, grimaced
      and then went to the window to stare down at the slow-moving traffic and
      at the stream of men and women, sheltering under umbrellas, hurrying to
      work. He heard a sound at the front door: letters being dropped into the
      box. Toni received many letters each morning from gibbering young men who
      adored her, but garry hoped there just might be a letter for him. He
      collected fifteen letters from the box, flicked through them quickly and
      found one for himself. The deckled edge, handmade paper of the envelope
      was impressive. He ripped it open and extracted a sheet of paper. The
      royal towers hotel london. W. I. Would mr. Garry edwards please call at
      the above address on february 11th at 11.30 hrs. And ask for mr. Armo
      shalik. (ref. Daily telegraph. Box. S.1012). Well, yes, garry thought, he
      would certainly call on mr armo shalik. With a name like that and with
      such an address there had tobe a smell of money. He took the letter into
      the small bedroom. Toni was sleeping heavily. She lay on her stomach, her
      shortie nightdress nicked up, her long, lovely legs spread wide. Garry sat
      on the edge of the bed and admired her. She really was delightfully
      beautiful. He lifted his hand and smacked her sharply on her bare rump.
      She squirmed, closed her legs, blinked and looked over her shoulder at
      him. He smacked her again and she hurriedly spun around and sat up.
      "that's assault! " she declared. "where are my pants? " he found them for
      her at the end of the bed and offered them. She regarded him, smiling. "do
      i need them? " "i shouldn't have thought so, " garry said with a grin.
      "i've had a letter. Could you turn your indecent mind to business for a
      moment? " she looked questioningly at him. "what's cooking? " he told her
      about the advertisement in the daily telegraph, that he had answered it,
      and now he had a reply. He gave her the letter. "the royal towers! The
      newest and the best! What a lovely name! Armo shalik! I smell bags and
      bags of gold and diamonds. " she tossed the letter into the air and threw
      her arms around garry's neck. Around 11.00 hours. Garry detached himself
      from toni's clutch, took a shower and then dressed in a blue blazer and
      dark-blue daks. He surveyed himself in the mirror. "a little dark under
      the eyes, " he said, straightening his tie. But that is to be expected.
      Still, i think i look healthy, handsome andhandmade . . . What do you
      think, you beautiful doll? Completely naked, toni was sitting in the
      armchair, sipping coffee. She regarded him affectionately. "you look
      absolutely gorgeous. " garry picked her out of the armchair and fondled
      her. Having kissed her, he dumped her back in the chair and left the
      apartment. At exactly 11.30 hrs. He approached the hall porter of the
      royal towers hotel and asked for mr. Armo shalik. The hall porter surveyed
      him with that blank expression all hall porters wear when they neither
      approve nor disapprove. He called a number, spoke quietly, then replaced
      the receiver. "tenth floor, sir. Suite 27. " garry was whisked up by the
      express lift to the tenth floor. He was conducted by the lift-man to the
      door of suite 27. He was obviously too important and too fragile to knock
      on the door. The lift-man did this service, bowed and retired. The smell
      of money, as far as garry was concerned, was now over-powering. He entered
      a small distinguished room where a girl sat behind a desk on which stood
      three telephones, an i. B. M. Golf ball typewriter, an intercom and a
      tape- recorder. The girl puzzled garry because although she had a nice
      figure, was dressed in a stylish black frock, was beautifully groomed, her
      hair immaculate, she was nothing to him but a sexless photograph of a
      woman long since dead. Her blank face, her immaculately plucked eyebrows,
      her pale lipstick merely emphasized her lack of charm: a robot that made
      him feel slightly uncomfortable. "mr. Edwards? Even her voice was
      metallic: a tape-recording badly reproduced. "that's me, " garry said, and
      because he never liked to be defeated by any woman, he gave her his
      charming smile. It had no effect. The girl touched a button, paused, then
      said, "mr. Edwards isit had no effect. The girl touched a button, paused,
      then said, "mr. Edwards is here, sir. " a green light flashed up on the
      intercom. Obviously, mr. Shalik didn't care to waste his breath. He
      preferred to press buttons than to talk. The girl got up, walked
      gracefully to a far door, opened it and stood aside. Impressed by all
      this, garry again tried his smile which again bounced off her the way a
      golf ball bounces off a brick wall. He moved past her into a large sunny
      room, luxuriously furnished with period pieces and impressive looking
      paintings that could have been by the great masters but probably weren't.
      At a vast desk sat a small, fat man, smoking a cigar, his chubby hands
      resting on the desk blotter. Garry judged him to be around forty-six years
      of age. He was dark-complexioned with close cut black hair, beady black
      eyes and a mouth that he used for food but not for smiles. Garry decided
      he was either an armenian or an egyptian. He had the stillness and the
      probing stare of power. As garry walked slowly to the desk, the beady
      black eyes examined him. They were x-ray eyes, and by the time garry had
      reached the desk, he had an uncomfortable feeling this fat little man knew
      him rather better than he knew himself. "sit down, mr. Edwards. " the
      accent was a little thick. A chubby hand waved to a chair. Garry sat down.
      He now regretted laying toni an hour ago. He felt a little depleted and he
      had an idea that this fat little man wouldn't have much time for depleted
      applicants for the job he was offering. Garry sat upright and tried to
      look intelligent. Shalik sucked in rich smelling smoke and allowed it to
      drift from his mouth like the smoke from a small, but active volcano. He
      picked up a sheet of paper which garry recognized as his letter of
      application and he studied it for several moments, then he tore it upand
      dropped it into a hidden wastepaper basket. "you are a helicopter pilot,
      mr. Edwards? " he asked, resting his hands on the blotter and regarding
      the ash of his cigar with more interest than he regarded garry. "that's
      correct. I saw your ad and i thought . . . " the chubby hand lifted,
      cutting garry off. "this nonsense you have written about yourself . . . At
      least, it proves you have imagination. " garry stiffened. "i don't get
      that. What do you mean? " shalik touched off his cigar ash into a gold
      bowl at his elbow. "i found your lies amusing, " he said. "i have had you
      investigated. You are garry edwards, aged twenty-nine, and you were born
      in ohio, u. S. A. Your father ran a reasonably successful service station.
      When you were sufficiently educated, you worked with your father and you
      came to know about motor cars. You and your father didn't get along.
      Probably faults on both sides, but that is of no interest to me. You had
      the opportunity to learn to fly: you took it. You have talent with
      machines. You got a job as an air chauffeur to a texas oilman who paid you
      well. You saved your money. The job didn't interest you. You met a wetback
      smuggler who persuaded you to smuggle mexicans into the states. The pay
      was good, and when the operation was over, you decided to go into the
      smuggling business. You went to tangiers, bought your own aircraft and
      flew consignments of various contrabands into france. You prospered as
      smugglers do for a time. However, you became greedy as smugglers do and
      you made a mistake. You were arrested. Your co-pilot managed to get your
      plane in the air while you were struggling with the police. He sold your
      plane and banked the money for you to have when you came out of the french
      prison after serving a three year sentence. You were deported from france
      and you are here. " shalik stubbed out his cigar and looked at garry.
      "would you say my information is correct? " garry laughed. "dead on the
      nail. " he got to his feet. "well, it was a try. I won't take up any more
      of your time. " shalik waved him back to his chair. "sit down. I think you
      are the man i am looking for. You can satisfy me that you have a pilot's
      licence and that you can handle a helicopter? " "of course, " garry
      returned and lugged out a plastic folder which he had brought along and
      laid it on the desk. Then he sat down again. Shalik examined the papers
      which the folder contained. He took his time, then he returned the folder.
      "satisfactory. " he took another cigar from his desk drawer, regarded it
      carefully, then cut the end with a gold cutter. "mr. Edwards, am i right
      in thinking you would be prepared to handle a job that is not entirely
      honest so long as the money is right? " garry smiled. "i'd like that
      qualified. What do you mean . . . Not entirely honest? " "difficult,
      unethical work that does not involve the police in any way, but pays
      handsomely. " "can you make it clearer than that? " "i am offering three
      thousand dollars a week for a three-week assignment. At the end of the
      assignment you will be nine thousand dollars better off. There are certain
      risks, but i can promise you the police won't come into it. " garry sat
      upright. Nine thousand dollars! "what are the risks? " "opposition. "
      shalik regarded his cigar with indifferent, beady eyes. "but life is made
      up of opposition, isn't it, mr. Edwards? " "just what do i have to do to
      earn this money? " "that will be explained to you tonight. You will not be
      alone. The risks and responsibilities will be shared. What i want to know
      now is if you are willing toresponsibilities will be shared. What i want
      to know now is if you are willing to do three weeks work for nine thousand
      dollars. " garry didn't hesitate. "yes . . . I am. " shalik nodded. "good.
      Then you will come here at 21.00 hrs. Tonight when i will introduce you to
      the other members of the team and i will explain the operation. " the
      chubby hand made a slight signal of dismissal. Garry got to his feet.
      "please don't talk about this assignment to anyone. Mr. Edwards, " shalik
      went on. "you must regard it as top secret. " "sure . . . I'll say
      nothing. " garry left the room. The girl at the desk got up and opened the
      door for him. He didn't bother to smile at her. His mind was too
      preoccupied. Nine thousand dollars! Wow! The girl watched him enter the
      lift and then she returned to her desk. She sat for some moments,
      listening. Then hearing nothing from the inner room, she softly opened a
      drawer in her desk and turned off a small tape-recorder whose spools were
      conveying tape through the recording head. Precisely at 21.00 hrs. Garry
      was shown into shalik's office by the dark-haired girl who he knew now by
      the name-plate on her desk to be natalie norman. There were two men
      sitting uneasily in chairs, smoking andwaiting. They both looked closely
      at garry as he took a chair. In his turn, he looked closely at them. The
      man on his left was short and heavily built. He reminded garry a little of
      rod steiger, the oscar-winning movie star. His close cut woolly hair was
      white, his washed out grey eyes shifty. His thin lips and square chin
      hinted at viciousness. The other man was some ten years younger: around
      garry's age. He was ofthe other man was some ten years younger: around
      garry's age. He was of middle height, thin, his hair bleached almost white
      by the sun and his skin burnt to a dark mahogany. He wore a straggly
      moustache and long sideboards. Garry liked the look of him immediately,
      but disliked the look of the other man. As he settled himself in the
      chair, a door at the far end of the room opened and shalik entered. "so
      you have all arrived, " he said, coming to his desk. He sat down and went
      through the ritual of lighting a cigar while he looked at each man in turn
      with intent, probing eyes. "let me introduce you to each other. " he
      pointed his cigar at garry. "this is mr. Garry edwards. He is a helicopter
      pilot and a car expert. He has spent three years in a french prison on
      smuggling charges. " the other two men looked sharply at garry who stared
      back at them. The cigar then pointed to the younger man. "this is mr.
      Kennedy jones who has flown from johannesburg to attend this meeting, "
      shalik went on. "mr. Jones is a safari expert. There is nothing he can't
      tell you about wild animals, south africa in general and the fitting out
      of an expedition into the african bush. I might add mr. Jones has had the
      misfortune to spend a few years in a pretoria jail. " jones stared up at
      the ceiling, a grin hovering around his humorous mouth. There was a pause,
      then shalik went on, "finally, this is mr. Lew fennel who is an expert
      safe breaker . . . I believe that is the term. He is regarded by the
      police and the underworld as the top man in his so-called profession. He
      too has served a number of years in prison. " shalik paused and looked at
      the three men. "so, gentlemen, you have something in common. " none of
      them said anything: they waited. Shalik opened a drawer in his desk and
      took out a folder. "the introductions concluded, let us get down to
      business. " he opened the folder and took from it a large glossy
      photograph. This he handed to fennel who stared with puzzled eyes at the
      medieval diamond ring shown in the photograph. He shrugged and passed the
      photograph to garry who in turn passed it to jones. "you are looking at a
      ring, " shalik said, "designed by caesar borgia. " he looked at the three
      men. "i take it you all know of caesar borgia? " "he's the guy who
      poisoned people, wasn't he? " fennel said. "i think that is a fair
      description. Yes, among many other things, he poisoned or caused to be
      poisoned a number of people. This ring you see in the photograph was
      designed by borgia and made by an unknown goldsmith in 1501. To look atwas
      designed by borgia and made by an unknown goldsmith in 1501. To look at
      the ring, it would be hard to believe that it is a lethal weapon, but that
      is what it is . . . A very lethal weapon. It works in this way. There is a
      tiny reservoir under the cluster of diamonds and this reservoir was filled
      with a deadly poison. In the cluster of diamonds is a microscopic hollow
      needle of exceptional sharpness. When borgia wished to get rid of an
      enemy, he had only to turn the ring so the diamonds and needle were worn
      inside and he had only to clasp the hand of his enemy to inflict a small
      scratch. The enemy would be dead in a few hours. "the ring was lost for
      four centuries. It turned up in the effects of a florentine banker who
      died with his wife and family in a car crash a couple of years ago. His
      effects were sold. Fortunately, an expert recognized the ring and bought
      it for a song. It was offered to me. " shalik paused to tap ash off his
      cigar. "among my various activities, i buy objets d'art and sell them to
      wealthy collectors. I knew of a client who specialized in borgia
      treasures. I sold him the ring. Six months later, the ring was stolen. It
      has taken me a long time to find out where it is. It was stolen by agents
      working for another collector who has acquired, through these agents,
      probably the finest collection of art treasures in the world. This
      operation, gentlemen, which i am asking you to handle, is for you three to
      recover the ring. " there was a long pause, then fennel, sitting forward,
      said, "you mean we steal it? " shalik looked at fennel with distaste.
      "putting it crudely, you could say that, " he said. "i have already
      pointed out there is no question of police interference. This collector
      has stolen the ring from my client. You take it from him. He is in no
      position to complain to the police. " fennel let his cigarette ash drop on
      the rich persian carpet as he asked, "how valuable is this ring? " "that
      doesn't concern you. It is, of course, valuable, but it has a specialized
      market. " shalik paused, then went on, "i will tell you a few details
      about the man who now has the ring. He is enormously rich. He has a
      compulsive urge to own the finest art treasures he can lay his hands on.
      He is utterly unscrupulous. He has a network of expert art thieves working
      for him. They have stolen many objets d'art from the world's greatest
      museums, and even from the vatican, to fill his museum which is without
      doubt the finest in the world. " feeling he should make a contribution to
      this discussion, garry asked, "andfeeling he should make a contribution to
      this discussion, garry asked, "and where is this museum? " "on the borders
      of basutoland and natal . . . Somewhere in the drakensberg mountains. "
      kennedy jones leaned forward. "would you be talking about max kahlenberg?
      " he asked sharply. Shalik paused to touch off his cigar ash. "you know of
      him? "who doesn't, who has lived in south africa? " "then suppose you tell
      these two gentlemen what you know about him. " "he's the man who has the
      ring? " shalik nodded. Jones drew in a long, slow breath. He rubbed his
      jaw, frowning, then lit a cigarette. As he exhaled smoke, he said, "i only
      know what is common knowledge. Kahlenberg is a bit of a mythical figure on
      which all kinds of weird rumours stick. I do know his father, a german
      refugee from the first world war, struck it rich, finding one of the
      biggest gold mines just outside jo'burg. Old karl kahlenberg was shrewd
      and no fool. He invested well and milked his mine dry. From what i hear,
      he ended up with millions. He married a local girl when he was over sixty
      years old. He married because he wanted a son to carry on his name. He got
      his son: max kahlenberg. There was a real mystery about the birth. No one
      except the doctor and the nurse saw the baby. There was a rumour it was a
      freak . . . Some even said it was a monster. Anyway, no one ever set eyes
      on the baby. The old man died in a hunting accident. Mrs. Kahlenberg moved
      from jo'burg and built a house in the heart of the drakensberg range. She
      continued to keep her son hidden, cutting herself off from all social
      contacts. She died some twenty years ago. Max kahlenberg remains a
      recluse. He is supposed to be as clever as his father. He has enlarged the
      house his mother built. He has around one hundred square miles of jungle
      surrounding the house and he employs a number of trained zulus to keep
      hikers, tourists and gapers away from the house. " jones paused, then
      leaning forward, stabbing his finger into the palm of his hand, he went
      on, "from what i've heard, getting near kahlenberg's place would be like
      trying to open an oyster with your fingers. "again there was a long pause,
      then fennel crushed out his cigarette and looked at shalik, his eyes
      narrowed. "is what he says right? " shalik lifted his fat shoulders. "a
      fairly accurate statement, " he said. "i have never said that this is an
      easy assignment. After all, i am paying very well. The approach to
      khalenberg's house is not easy, but not impossible. I have a considerable
      amount of information which will help you. " "that's fine, " fennel said
      with a little sneer, "but suppose we get to the house . . . How do we get
      in? " "although mr. Jones has a fair knowledge of kahlenberg's background,
      " shalik said. "he has omitted or perhaps he doesn't know the fact that
      although kahlenberg is a cripple, he is fond of beautiful women. " he
      leaned back in his chair. "every fortress has its soft underbelly if you
      know where to look for it. I have a woman who will act as your trojan
      horse. If she can't get you into kahlenberg's house, no one can. " he
      pressed a button his desk. There was a long pause, then the door behind
      shalik opened and the most sensational, beautiful woman any of the three
      men, gaping at her, had ever seen, came slowly into the room and paused by
      shalik's desk. Chapter two some ten years ago, armo shalik, sick of his
      small way of life, let it be known by a discreet advertisement in an
      egyptian newspaper that he was prepared to undertake for a reasonable fee
      any assignment that presented difficulties. He received only one answer to
      his advertisement, but it was enough, since his client was an arabian
      prince who wished to have inside information concerning a future oil deal
      between a rival of his and an american oil company. By using the prince's
      money and his own brains, shalik obtained the information. The deal netted
      him $10,000, a modest enough fee, but the prince was grateful, and he
      passed the word around that if you were in difficulties, if you wished for
      inside information, shalik was the man to consult. The following year with
      the capital he had saved, shalik moved to london. He acquired a small list
      of extremely wealthy clients who continually consulted him. Money, of
      course, was no object. Shalik's fees rose sharply, but he always
      delivered. Among his clients were three texas oil millionaires, four
      arabian princes, two enormously wealthy american women, a greek shipping
      tycoon and a number of british, french and german industrialists. He was
      often to say, "nothing is impossible with unlimited money and brains. " he
      would pause to stare at his client. "you will supply the money . . . I the
      brains. " armo shalik prospered. In the early days, he considered whether
      to have a permanent staff to work under him, but he decided this was
      economically unsound. Shalik never wasted a dime. To keep a staff of
      experts on his payroll would mean half of them most of the time would be
      drawing on his money and doing nothing. He decided to fit men and women to
      the job when the job arrived. He discovered a not too scrupulous detective
      agency who were prepared not only to recommend likely applicants without
      asking awkward questions, but also to screen them, giving him intimate
      details of their background. It was in this way that he had found lew
      fennel, kennedy jones and garry edwards. His permanent staff was small:
      consisting of natalie norman who acted as his receptionist and personal
      assistant, and georgesherborn who was his private secretary and valet. But
      shalik soon found that his assignments became more complicated and
      therefore more lucrative, he needed a woman in the field to be permanently
      at his disposal: a woman who had to be trained to work with and for him: a
      woman of exceptional talents and exceptional looks. Such a woman could be
      more useful to him than a dozen male experts. During the past years, he
      had hired a number of women to work with his experts, but more often than
      not they had failed him: either losing their nerve at a crucial moment or
      becoming sentimentally attached to the men they were working with, and
      this was something shalik abominated. So he set out to find a woman he
      could train to become his ideal woman operator. She had to be beautiful,
      perfectly built, talented and to be prepared to dedicate herself to his
      work. Shalik travelled extensively, and while visiting the major cities of
      the world, he was constantly on the look-out for the woman he needed. He
      came across several likely applicants, but when he approached them, they
      either would have nothing to do with his proposition or proved to be
      beautiful but brainless. After some six months, he began to despair,
      wondering if he had set his sights too high. Then one day he had a letter
      from one of his rich, spoilt women clients, living in tokyo, who asked him
      to buy her a leopard skin coat, a mink stole and a broadtail coat for
      evening wear. He was to get these furs from finn larson, a copenhagen
      furrier who had her measurements and knew exactly what she required. Since
      the woman paid shalik $21,000, a year as a retaining fee and since he
      charged fifteen per cent on all purchases made on her behalf and since he
      was in need of a brief vacation, he was happy to oblige. Natalie norman
      telephoned finn larson in copenhagen to alert him that shalik was coming
      and what he wanted. She was told that there was to be a lunch held at
      l'angleterre hotel for a number of larson's special clients when models
      would display his furs and the clients would eat interesting danish food,
      larson hoped mr. Shalik would attend. Shalik arrived at the hotel the
      following day and went to theprivate room that larson used for his
      excellent lunches and was welcomed by larson, a balding, heavily-built
      dane who gripped his hand and led him to a table before hurrying away to
      welcome yet another of his clients. While shalik was eating his lunch,
      girls came in to display larson's beautiful furs. Then suddenly, as a girl
      swept in, wearing a magnificent leopard skin coat, shalik paused in his
      eating. After six months of searching, this was his moment of truth. He
      was certain this time this was the girl he was looking for. Above average
      height, with tawny hair, hanging in silken waves to her shoulder blades,
      this girl possibly twenty-six or so years of age was the most
      sensationally, sensually beautiful feminine creation he had ever seen. Her
      jade green eyes, her full lips that gave promise of sexual excitement, her
      long tapering legs, her slim lovely hands made a picture of a male dream
      of desirability. Shalik lost interest in his lunch as he watched her move
      with the arrogant walk of a trained model to the end of the room. She
      turned and walked back past him. He scarcely glanced at the leopard skin
      coat. When she had gone, to be replaced by another girl, wearing a seal
      skin coat, shalik beckoned to larson who came over. "i'll take the leopard
      skin coat, " shalik said. "it is for mrs. Van ryan. " he paused, then
      looked up and asked, "who is the girl who modelled the coat? " larson
      smiled. "almost as magnificent as my coat, don't you think? She is gaye
      desmond . . . An american freelance model who comes here from time to
      time. I use her for my leopard skins . . . No other girl has such flair to
      show off leopard. " shalik took out his wallet, extracted his card and
      handed it to larson. "would you be so kind as to give her my card? " he
      asked. "i believe i can employ her should she need employment. You might
      mention to her who i am. " shalik regarded larson. "you know, mr. Larson,
      i am always serious. This is strictly business. You will be doing the girl
      a favour. " larson, who knew shalik, had no hesitation. Later, while
      shalik was sitting in his suite, reading a complicated legal document, the
      telephone bell rang. He lifted the receiver. He lifted the receiver. "this
      is gaye desmond. " he liked her rich contralto voice. "you sent me your
      card. " "thank you for ringing, miss desmond. I have a proposition i would
      like to discuss with you. Could we have dinner together at the belle
      terresse, tivoli, at 21.00 hrs? " she said yes, and hung up. She arrived
      punctually which pleased shalik, and together they went to a table on the
      terrace that overlooked the lighted pool and the flowers that make tivoli
      famous. "it is a pity we didn't meet in paris, miss desmond, " shalik said
      as he began to examine the menu. "the food here is indifferent. In paris i
      could have offered you a meal worthy of your beauty. " she was wearing a
      simple blue dress with a mink stole. Diamonds glittered at her ears as she
      tossed her tawny coloured hair back from her shoulders. "i believe in
      eating what a country offers, " she said. "why yearn for better food in
      paris when you are in copenhagen? " shalik liked that. He nodded. "so what
      will you have? " she had no hesitation, and this also pleased shalik.
      Women who stare vacantly at a menu and can't make up their minds bored
      him. She chose danish shrimps and the breast of duck in wine sauce. Having
      taken a little longer to examine the menu, shalik decided her choice was
      not only safe, but sound. He ordered the same. "miss desmond, " shalik
      said when the waiter had gone. "i am looking for a woman to help me in my
      work. I am a rather special agent who looks afterwoman to help me in my
      work. I am a rather special agent who looks after extremely wealthy,
      spoilt people, clever business men and even princes. I boast that nothing
      is impossible. Nothing is impossible if you have money and brains. " he
      paused, regarding her. "however, i believe my work would be made easier if
      i had a woman like yourself working for me permanently. I must warn you it
      would be exacting work: sometimes dangerous, but always within the law of
      the country in which i operate. " this statement was untrue. Recently,
      shalik had pulled off a number of illegal currency deals in london that
      could have landed him in jail had they been discovered, but shalik's
      philosophy was that so long as he wasn't found out, any deal was within
      the law. "the pay will be good. You will have your own apartment at the
      royal towers hotel in london, paid by me. You will have many opportunities
      to travel. " he regarded her with his black, beady eyes. "and i assure
      you, miss desmond, this will be a strictly business association. " the
      tiny, pink, delicious shrimps now arrived with slices of toast, and there
      was a pause. While gaye buttered her toast, she asked, "what makes you
      imagine i am suitable for such a post, mr. Shalik? " shalik nibbled at his
      shrimps. He regretfully avoided the toast. He was four kilos overweight
      and was determined to make a sacrifice. "instinct, i suppose. I think you
      are just the woman i am looking for. " "you say the pay will be good . . .
      Just what does that mean? " he ate another three shrimps before saying,
      "suppose you tell me about yourself. I can then make a valuation. " she
      sipped the chilled hock and regarded him with her green eyes: thoughtful,
      shrewd, calculating eyes that pleased him. "well . . . " she suddenly
      smiled and her smile lit up her face, making it gay and charming. "as you
      can see, i am beautiful. I am intelligent. You will discover this. I speak
      french, italian and spanish fluently. I can get along in german. I was
      practically born on a horse. My father bred horses in kentucky. I ski
      well. I can handle a sailing boat and, of course, any kind of motorboat. I
      have been a racing driver and there is nothing i don't know about cars. I
      understand men and what they what. Sex doesn't frighten me. I know how to
      please men if . . . And only if. . . I have to. I earn a comfortable
      living modelling specialized clothes, but i like money and want to make
      more. "but i like money and want to make more. " shalik finished his
      shrimps and then stroked his thick nose. "is that all? " she laughed.
      "isn't it enough? " "yes, i think so. Can you handle firearms? " she
      lifted her eyebrows. "why should i need to? " "since you are otherwise so
      well equipped, i think you should have weapon training and also training
      in self-defence. This i can arrange. When a woman is as beautiful as you
      and when she may have to mix with dubious types of men, it is sound for
      her to understand the art of self-defence. " they paused while the waiter
      served the duck and poured a margaux '59 which shalik had ordered in a
      moment of recklessness. The price was outrageous, but the wine excellent.
      "now it is your turn, " she said. She cut into the duck and grimaced.
      "it's tough. " "of course. What did you expect? This is copenhagen, not
      paris. " he looked at her across the candle-lit table. "my turn . . . .
      For what? " "your turn to make a valuation. I've told you about myself.
      Value me. " shalik liked her direct approach. "if you are prepared to do
      exactly what i tell you, miss desmond, " he said as he began to cut the
      duck into small pieces. "if you are prepared to be at my beckbegan to cut
      the duck into small pieces. "if you are prepared to be at my beck and call
      for eleven months in each year . . . The remaining month will be yours to
      do as you wish. If you are prepared to take a course in self-defence, then
      i will pay you $10,000 a year with a one per cent cut on whatever i make
      on assignments you help me with. At a rough guess this should net you
      $25,000 a year. " she drank a little of the margaux. "at least the wine is
      good, isn't it? " "it should be, at the price they charge for it, " shalik
      said sourly. He hated wasting his money. "what do you say? " she toyed
      with her glass as she considered his proposal, then she shook her head.
      "no . . . I am not interested. I could become an old man's mistress for
      twice that sum. You are asking me to hand myself over to you as a slave
      for eleven months, leading no life of my own during those months, to be
      entirely at your beck and call. " she laughed. "no, mr. Shalik, that is no
      kind of a price for what you are offering. " shalik would have been
      disappointed if she had said otherwise. "so . . . Suppose you tell me
      under what conditions you will work for me? " he was pleased she told him
      without hesitation. "$30,000 a year whether i work or not, and five per
      cent of whatever you make in the deals in which i am concerned. " shalik
      shook his head slowly and sadly. "then i'm sorry, miss desmond. I must
      look elsewhere. " they looked at each other and she gave him a charming
      smile, but he saw there was a jeering light in her eyes. "then i'm sorry
      too. So i must also look elsewhere. ""then i'm sorry too. So i must also
      look elsewhere. " shalik now knew she was the woman he was looking for and
      he settled down to bargain, but here he found his master and this pleased
      him. He hated to be defeated, but he realized if she could defeat him, the
      men she would have to mix with at his bidding would be as pawns in her
      hands. At the end of the meal, and after shalik had paid the outrageous
      bill, they had come to an agreement. A basic salary of $30,000 a year,
      plus four per cent of shalik's earnings which involved her cooperation, to
      be paid into a swiss bank, tax free, which shalik decided ruefully would
      net her at least seven per cent of his take. Once this was agreed, she
      came to london and went through a self-defence course that shalik arranged
      for her. Her instructors were delighted with her. "this woman is now
      highly proficient in defending herself, " they told shalik. "she can cope
      with any emergency. " completely satisfied with his find, shalik installed
      her in a small suite on the floor below his at the royal towers hotel, and
      within two months she had quickly proved her worth. She handled two
      assignments not only successfully, but with a polish that delighted
      shalik. The first assignment was to obtain a chemical formula required by
      a rival company. The second assignment was to obtain advance information
      about a big shipping merger which netted the client a considerable profit
      on the stock market: part of which he handed to shalik. In both cases,
      gaye had had to sleep with the two men who supplied the information
      required. Shalik asked for no details. He was only too pleased to turn the
      information she gave him into cash. Now, she had worked for him for six
      months and she had more than earned her basic salary. Delighted with her,
      he had sent her off on a skiing vacation. He was sure she hadn't gone
      alone, but what was left of her private life was no concern of his. Then
      the borgia ring affair came up and he had sent a telegram to gstaad
      telling her to return immediately. She returned by the first available
      aircraft and when she walked into his office, she returned by the first
      available aircraft and when she walked into his office, burned golden
      brown by the swiss sun, her tawny hair around her shoulders, shalik
      thought she looked magnificent. He explained about the borgia ring and was
      pleased by her interest. "you will like natal, " he said. "the country is
      splendid. The three men who will work with you are all experts and should
      present no difficulties for you. " he stared at his evenly burning cigar.
      "i think i should warn you that there are risks. Kahlenberg is dangerous.
      " she shrugged her beautiful shoulders. Her smile was confident. "many men
      are dangerous, " she said quietly, "so are many women. " as gaye desmond
      paused beside shalik, the three men got to their feet. While shalik
      introduced them, gaye regarded them searchingly. She liked the look of
      kennedy jones. She decided he was harmless and would be easy to handle and
      could be fun. Her green eyes swept over fennel. This man was not only
      dangerous but he could be tricky to handle. Her experience of men and the
      expression in his washed out grey eyes as he looked at her, told her
      sooner or later, there would have to be a showdown with him. Then she took
      in garry edwards who was looking at her with an appreciative expression
      that she found flattering and pleasing. He was all right, she decided.
      Well, they were a mixed bunch to travel with, but at least two of them
      could be handled. The fat one was bound to be a nuisance. "this is miss
      gaye desmond . . . Our trojan horse, " shalik said. "that i love, " gaye
      laughed. "i would rather be helen than the horse. " "sit down, please. "
      shalik drew up a chair for gaye. "miss desmond will travel with you. You
      will be flying to johannesburg on tuesday. I have arranged for your rooms
      at the rand. International hotel. You will stay there until mr. Jonesyour
      rooms at the rand. International hotel. You will stay there until mr.
      Jones has organized the expedition. I have also arranged for the hire of a
      helicopter which miss desmond and mr. Edwards will use. " he touched ash
      off his cigar, then went on, "i have managed to obtain a certain amount of
      information about kahlenberg's place, but none of this information is
      completely reliable. Before you can hope to get at the ring, it is
      essential for miss desmond to get into kahlenberg's house and check the
      information i have obtained: this information is to do with various
      security measures and where the museum is located. Miss desmond will pose
      as a professional photographer after wild game. I have arranged that she
      is credited to animal world which is a sound, small american magazine for
      whom i have done past favours. It is possible that kahlenberg might check,
      and it would be stupid not to be covered. Mr. Edwards will be her
      professional pilot. A helicopter is the ideal machine from which to get
      photographs of wild animals. Kahlenberg has an airfield. You two . . . "
      here shalik looked at gaye and garry, "will land on the airfield. Your
      story will be that you saw the house from the air and can you take
      photographs? You will be refused, of course, but i am certain kahlenberg
      will want to meet miss desmond. " "but suppose he doesn't? " garry said.
      Shalik frowned at him. "i said i was certain, and that means he will. I
      don't use words lightly. " the snub administered, shalik went on, "i have
      no idea where the museum is. I imagine it must be somewhere in the house
      which is a vast one storey building. As the museum contains many stolen
      treasures, it will be well hidden and well guarded. One of my agents in
      durban, some eight years ago, happened to be watching a ship unload and
      noticed a considerable number of crates coming ashore with kahlenberg's
      name on them. Knowing i was interested in khalenberg, he investigated. The
      crates came from bahlstrom of sweden who you may know are the best safe
      makers and security experts in the world. " he glanced at fennel. "am i
      telling you anything new? " fennel grinned. "i know all about bahlstrom.
      Years ago, i worked for them. They are good. " "yes, mr. Fennel, " shalik
      said. "this is the main reason why i am hiring you. "he again touched off
      his cigar ash and continued, "fortunately, my agent was intelligent. He
      obtained a copy of the invoices from the shipping agent at some cost and
      sent it to me. I give it to you now to examine. It is possible with your
      knowledge of bahlstrom's security system and with these invoices, you may
      get some idea of kahlenberg's security setup. " he handed a plastic
      envelope to fennel who glanced at it and then shoved it in his hip pocket.
      "you have until monday morning to let me know what you think. " "okay, "
      fennel said, crossing one fat leg over the other. "i'll tell you. " shalik
      turned to garry. "mr. Edwards, i have aerial maps of the drakensberg range
      and of kahlenberg's estate. " again another plastic envelope passed across
      the desk. "i will want you to tell me if you can land the helicopter from
      a place chosen by mr. Jones on the kahlenberg airfield. This we will also
      discuss on monday. " garry nodded, taking the envelope. Shalik now turned
      to kennedy jones. "you will be responsible for fitting out the expedition
      and for transport. You and mr. Fennel will go by road while miss desmond
      and mr. Edwards fly. You can spend what you like but you must insure
      against the many difficulties which you could meet on the way in. The
      route to kahlenberg's estate is exceptionally difficult at this season
      when the rains can be expected. But this is your affair. You will also
      have to find a way through the circle of zulus who guard the approaches.
      You are the expert, so i don't propose making any suggestions. " "i'll
      take care of it, " jones said. "well then, we will have our final meeting
      on monday, " shalik said. "we will then clear up the final details. Any
      questions? " fennel leaned forward. "how about some money? We are being
      paid nine thousand each for this caper, but how about something in
      advance? "but how about something in advance? " shalik made a grimace that
      could pass for as a smile. "i was expecting that request from you. " he
      took from a drawer four envelopes and handing one to gaye, he passed the
      other three across his desk. "you will find in each envelope blank
      travellers cheques to the total of $3,000. When you have successfully
      completed your mission, you will get the balance. " he glanced at his gold
      omega. "then we meet here at 09.30 hrs. On monday. " gaye left the room by
      the door behind shalik. Garry and ken jones watched her going with regret.
      They started towards the far door as fennel got to his feet. "mr. Fennel .
      . . " fennel looked at shalik. "there are a few additional things to
      discuss without wasting the time of these other gentlemen, " shalik said
      quietly. Fennel shrugged and sat down again. Shalik waved to the other
      two, dismissing them. When they had gone, shalik selected another cigar,
      clipped the end and lit it while he looked stonily at fennel. "it is
      necessary, mr. Fennel, to have a straight talk with you. Your two
      companions have both served jail sentences, but you can hardly describe
      them as criminals. However, you are not only a criminal, but a dangerous
      and vicious one. I have selected you for this operation because of your
      expertise, but don't imagine i am ignorant of your criminal background. I
      know you are on the run and anxious to get out of england. You betrayed
      five criminals in order to reduce your own sentence and the leader of this
      gang a man called moroni has sworn to kill you. An attempt was made last
      night, but failed. The second attempt might not fail. " shalik paused to
      stare at fennel who was now sitting up straight, his eyes glittering. "so
      from what i am telling you, mr. Fennel, you willsee i keep myself well
      informed about the people i employ. Now i have received additional
      information about you. You are wanted for three vicious murders in hong
      kong, cairo and istanbul. Two of your victims were females: the third was
      a male prostitute. I have evidence of these crimes that interpol would
      gladly receive. Does all this that i am telling you, mr. Fennel, interest
      you? " fennel moistened his lips with his tongue. "are you threatening me?
      I got the idea we are working together. " "yes . . . We are working
      together, but that doesn't mean i can't threaten you. There are two things
      you are to keep constantly in mind. " shalik pointed his cigar at fennel.
      "the first point is you will leave gaye desmond strictly alone. As soon as
      she came into this room, your disgusting mind began to wonder about her.
      You were thinking that in the african bush you would have opportunities to
      behave in the animal way that comes naturally to you. So i am warning you:
      try something like that with miss desmond, and i promise you interpol will
      have your dossier from me. Is that clear? " fennel forced an uneasy grin.
      "you hold the aces, " he said with an attempt at bravado. "you are reading
      me wrong, but okay, so she is like my mother. " shalik grimaced. "if you
      will excuse the personal remark . . . I feel sorry for your mother. "
      fennel gave a hard, barking laugh. "you don't have to. She was one of the
      smartest thieves in the racket. If you want to be sorry for anyone, be
      sorry for my old man. He cut this throat when they put my mother away for
      ten years. " "i am not interested in your family history, " shalik said
      curtly. "my second point is this. I want this ring. The operation won't be
      easy, but a man of your experience and ruthlessness should be able to
      handle it. However, if you fail, i see no reason why i shouldn't pass your
      dossier to interpol . . . So you must understand that i will not tolerate
      failure. "understand that i will not tolerate failure. " fennel bared his
      teeth in a snarling grin. "i'll get the goddam ring for you, but if so
      much depends on me, how about some extra money? " "i will consider that
      when i have the ring. Now get out! " fennel stared at him, but shalik was
      reaching for the telephone. As he began to dial a number, fennel got up
      and went into the inner room where natalie norman was typing. He didn't
      look at her, but went out into the corridor and to the lift. When he had
      gone, and when she was satisfied she could hear shalik talking on the
      telephone, she turned off the hidden tape-recorder and removed the spool.
      Garry shut himself in a telephone booth and called toni who answered
      immediately. "we're celebrating, chicken, " he said. "i'm hungry. Meet me
      at the rib room, carlton towers in exactly one hour from this minute, "
      and he hung up cutting off her squeal of excitement. He knew he had to
      give her at least an hour to get ready. Toni was a languid and slow
      dresser. By the time he reached the rib room he was pleasantly high,
      having drunk four vodka martinis in the bar of the royal towers hotel. Ken
      jones had left him, saying he had a date with a girl friend. They had
      paused in the crowded lobby of the hotel and jones had asked, "what do you
      think of it all? " "it's a job and the money's nice, " garry returned.
      "you and i will get along. I feel that. It's fennel . . . " jones grinned.
      Jones grinned. "what are you worrying about? You have gorgeous and a
      chopper. I have fennel. " "well, watch him. " "you bet . . . So long, see
      you monday. Happy bed bouncing, " and jones went off into the cold, wet
      night. Toni, looking ravishing, turned up at the rib room just when garry
      was losing patience. "i'm damn well starving, " he complained. "you're
      late! " "i know, sweetie, but i just can't help it. " she flicked her long
      eyelashes at him. "like me? " but now garry had met gaye desmond, toni
      white seemed suddenly a little young, trying a little too hard, and less
      exciting. "you're wonderful. " the four martinis gave his voice
      conviction. They moved into the restaurant. As they sat down, toni asked,
      "so you got the job? ""you don't imagine we would be here if i hadn't? "
      "let's order and then you tell me, huh? " "don't say huh . . . Only
      american businessmen say that. " toni giggled. "god! I'm starving too!
      Let's order quickly. " the maitre d'hotel came over. Garry ordered a dozen
      0ysters each with a half bottle of chablis, followed by the scotch beef
      with a baked potato in jacket and a bottle of batailley 1961. The dessert,
      it was decided, should be a lemon sorbet. "mmmmmm! " toni purred. "this
      job must be marvellous. You do realize this is going to cost a
      f-o-r-t-u-n-e? " "so what? I'm worth a fortune. " under the cover of the
      table, garry slid his hand up toni's mini skirt, but she clamped her legs
      together. "mr. Edwards! I'm surprised at you! " she said. Garry disengaged
      his hand. "i'm continually surprising myself, miss white. " the oysters
      arrived. "well, tell me . . . What is the job? " toni asked as she cut a
      fat oyster from its shell. "god! I adore oysters! " "don't be greedy, "
      garry said, forking an oyster into his mouth. "it's never becoming for a
      young and sexy girl to sound greedy. " "shut up! Tell me about the job.
      ""well, it's a dilly. I go to natal, and as your geography is as dodgy as
      mine, natal is somewhere in south africa. I lug an american photographer
      around in a helicopter so she can take photos of wild animals. It is a
      three week assignment and the money is very acceptable. " toni's oyster
      hovered before her mouth. She looked searchingly at garry who avoided her
      eyes. "she? You mean you are flying a woman around jungles for three
      weeks? " "that's it, " garry said carelessly. "now don't start getting
      into a state. I've met her. She's around forty-five, looks pregnant, and
      is the type who slaps you on the back and picks her teeth immediately
      after a meal. " toni stared at him. "but that sounds horrible. " "doesn't
      it? Still the money is good and after all she could have had a beard and a
      wooden leg, couldn't she? " toni nodded and attacked another oyster. "yes,
      i suppose so. " there was a long silence while the waiter removed the
      debris and a longer silence while the beef was served. Garry stole a look
      at her face and then grimaced. Hell! He thought, she knows i'm lying. Now
      what am i going to do? He said gently, "toni, darling, have you got
      something on your mind? " "should i have? " she didn't look at him but
      concentrated on her beef. "they have here the most marvellous beef in the
      world. ""i wouldn't say in the world. I remember in hong kong. . . "
      "never mind hong kong. Please tell me how much you are being paid to
      convey a pregnant woman around the jungle. " "i didn't say she was
      pregnant, i said she looks pregnant. Not quite the same thing. " "how
      much? " "three thousand dollars, " garry lied. "well, that's very nice. So
      you will be away for three weeks? " "yes. " toni continued to eat. There
      was a dazed expression in her eyes that began to bother garry. "i hear
      natal is pretty interesting, " he said. "it could be quite a trip. "
      "shall we try to enjoy our dinner, garry? This is the first time i've been
      to the rib room. " "i thought we were enjoying it. Are you trying to be
      dramatic? " her long lashes flickered at him, then she dug into her baked
      potato. "please let us enjoy something even if we can't enjoy each other.
      " that spoilt his meal. Impatiently he pushed aside his plate and lit a
      cigarette. Toni ate slowly, obviously enjoying the beef. They said nothing
      until she had finished, then when the waiter had removed the plates, garry
      said, "just what thefinished, then when the waiter had removed the plates,
      garry said, "just what the hell has suddenly bit you, toni? This is
      supposed to be a celebration. " "i love sorbets. Queen victoria used to
      stuff sorbets down the throats of all her over-stuffed guests half-way
      through the menu. The sorbets allowed them to go on stuffing. " "i didn't
      know you were so well educated, darling. I asked what is biting you. " the
      lemon sorbets arrived. Garry, in a fit of frustrated rage, crushed his
      cigarette in the ice. "is that how you feel, mr. Oxfam? " toni asked,
      spooning ice into her pretty mouth. "look, toni, i don't know what's come
      over you, but this has turned into a drag. " "has it? " she put down her
      spoon. "garry, dear, i am always asking myself how it is i land up with a
      lover who lies to me. It is beginning to bore me. " they stared at each
      other. "women who are able to spot my lies bore me too, " garry said
      quietly. "there it is. " toni lifted her hands helplessly. "damn you, i
      love you. Let's get out of here and go home and have sex. " he paid the
      bill without shuddering with one of the $50 travellers' cheques shalik had
      given him. In the taxi, toni sat away from him, putting her feet up on the
      tip-up seat. "this photographer . . . She's marvellous, isn't she? " she
      asked. "darling garry, don't lie to me . . . Tell me. " he watched the
      street lights and the rain beating on the pavement, and he sighed. He
      watched the street lights and the rain beating on the pavement, and he
      sighed. "okay . . . Yes . . . She's marvellous. " toni's small, pretty
      face tightened with misery. "will you be coming back, garry? " "now look,
      toni . . . " "i'm asking you . . . Will you be coming back to me? " he
      hesitated, thinking of the tawny-haired woman who now filled his mind. "i
      don't know. " "well, thanks for being truthful. " she moved closer to him
      and slid into his arms. Fennel told the taxi driver to take him to the end
      of hornsey road where jacey had his shabby flat. As the taxi passed
      jacey's building, fennel peered through the rain splashed window, looking
      for trouble, but saw nothing to alarm him. At the end of the long road, he
      paid off the taxi and walked back, keeping in the shadows, his eyes alert
      for trouble. He reached the entrance of the block, stepped inside and
      looked at the steep stairs leading to the upper floor of the building, lit
      by a yellow light bulb. Instinct warned him he could be walking into
      danger. He hesitated, then moving silently into the smelly lobby, he
      stepped into the telephone booth behind thesilently into the smelly lobby,
      he stepped into the telephone booth behind the stairs. He dialled jacey's
      number. He listened to the steady ringing for some minutes, then he hung
      up. It was unlikely jacey would be out in this cold rain at this hour . .
      . It was after 22.00 hrs. Jacey got up early and went to bed early. Fennel
      hesitated. His equipment which he had to have for the natal trip was up
      there. He had to get it. It was securely hidden in the rafters of jacey's
      attic. It would want some finding if they search for it. He hadn't told
      jacey where he had hidden it so they would have no success if they had put
      pressure on jacey. He grinned suddenly as an idea came into his mind. He
      lifted the receiver and dialled 999. To the answering police voice, he
      said, "there's bad trouble at 332 homsey road . . . Top flat . . . Could
      be murder, " and he hung up. He then moved cautiously out of the booth,
      listened, then walked into the darkness and the rain. Keeping in the
      shadows, he crossed the road and stood in the entrance of a dark alley to
      wait. He didn't have to wait long. Two police cars came swiftly out of the
      night, pulled up outside the building and four policemen ran up the steps.
      Fennel looked up at jacey's darkened windows. After a few moments a light
      flashed up. He waited, leaning against the damp wall of the alley,
      shivering slightly in the bleak cold. After some twenty minutes, three of
      the policemen came out, shoving two powerfully built men into the police
      cars. The two men were handcuffed. They drove away. That left one
      policeman up there. What had happened to jacey? Fennel wondered. Well, he
      couldn't wait. He had to get his equipment. He took his handkerchief from
      his pocket and tied it across his face, making a mask, then he crossed the
      street and entered the building and ran silently up the stairs. When he
      reached jacey's floor, he paused to listen. Jacey's front door stood open.
      He could hear the policeman moving around in the room. Fennel crept like a
      ghost to the door and glanced in. The far wall was splashed with blood.
      His back turned to him, the policeman was kneeling by jacey's body. Fennel
      grimaced. So jacey, the poor stupid sod, had been carved. He didn'tfennel
      grimaced. So jacey, the poor stupid sod, had been carved. He didn't
      hesitate. Moving swiftly, he was on the policeman before the man realized
      he was being attacked. With laced fingers, fennel smashed his hands down
      on the man's bent neck with one shattering, terrible blow. The policeman
      spread out over jacey's blood-stained body. Fennel darted into the tiny,
      evil smelling bedroom and up the ladder that led to the attic. In seconds,
      he had got the bag containing his equipment, then slid down the ladder,
      out on to the landing. He paused to listen, then went down the stairs to
      the ground floor, three at the time. Panting, he reached the front door
      where he paused again, hearing the distant sound of a police siren. He
      slid out into the rain, ran across the road and backed against the wall of
      the alley as an ambulance and two police cars came roaring to a
      standstill. Fennel grunted . . . Well timed, he thought, then set off by
      the back alleys until he reached a main road. He saw a cruising taxi and
      waved. The taxi pulled up and he told the driver to take him to the royal
      towers hotel. He arrived outside shalik's suite and rapped on the door.
      There was a delay, then the door opened. George sherborn, a pertly,
      elderly man who acted as shalik's confidential secretary and valet
      regarded fennel with startled disapproval. He knew all about fennel and
      after hesitating, stood aside and let him in. "mr. Shalik is away for the
      weekend, " he said. "what is it? " "i've got to get the hell out of the
      country fast, " fennel said wiping his sweating face with the back of his
      hand. "i'm in dead trouble. The creeps after me found my pal and carved
      him. The cops are there now. It won't take them long to find my
      fingerprints all over the goddamn place, and when they do, i'm blown. "
      sherborn was never flustered. He could rise to any emergency with the
      calmness of a bishop presiding over a tea party. He knew without fennel
      the borgia ring operation couldn't succeed. He told fennel to wait and
      went into the inner room, shutting the door. Half an hour later, he
      returned. "a car is waiting for you downstairs to take you to lydd, " he
      said. "you fly by air taxi to le touquet. There will be another car at le
      touquet to take you to the normandy hotel, paris where you will stay until
      the johannesburg plane leaves. Your ticket will be at orly, waiting for
      you. " sherborn's round gooseberry eyes regarded fennel impersonally. "you
      understand the cost of all this will be deducted from your fee? "deducted
      from your fee? " "who says so, fatty? " fennel snarled. Sherborn looked at
      him with contempt. "don't be impertinent. Mr. Shalik will be most
      displeased by what has happened. Now get off. " he handed fennel a sheet
      of paper. "all the necessary details are here for you. You have your
      passport? " "oh, get stuffed! " fennel snapped and snatching the paper,
      hurried to the lift. Five minutes later, seated in a hired jaguar, he was
      being whisked down to lydd. Chapter three ten minutes after the meeting
      between gaye, garry, jones and fennel had broken up, shalik had come into
      natalie's office, an overcoat over his arm and a weekend case in his hand.
      She paused in her work and looked up. To shalik, natalie norman was part
      of his background: useful, exceedingly efficient: a dedicated, colourless
      woman who had been with him for three years. He had chosen her to be his
      personal assistant from a short list of highly qualified women an agency
      had submitted to him. Natalie norman was thirty-eight years of age. She
      spoke fluent french and german, and she had an impressive degree in
      economics. With no apparent interests outside shalik's office she was, to
      him, a machine who worked efficiently and who was essential to him. Shalik
      liked sensual, beautiful women. To him, natalie norman with her plain
      looks, her pallid complexion was merely a robot. When he spoke to her, he
      seldom looked at her. "i shall be away for the weekend, miss norman, " he
      said, pausing at her desk. "i will ask you to come in tomorrow for an hour
      to see to the mail, then take the weekend off. I have a meeting on monday
      morning at 09.00 hrs. , " and he was gone. There was no look, no smile and
      not even a "nice weekend'. The following morning, she arrived at her usual
      time, dealt with the mail and was beginning to clear her desk as george
      sherborn came in. She loathed sherborn as he loathed her. To her thinking,
      he was a boot-licking, sensual, fat old horror. On the day she began to
      work for shalik, sherborn, his fat face flushed, had run his hand over her
      corsetted buttocks as she was sealing a large envelope full of legal
      documents. His touch revolted her. She had spun around and slashed his fat
      face with the side of the envelope, making his nose bleed. From then on
      they hated each other, but had worked together, both ably servingfrom then
      on they hated each other, but had worked together, both ably serving
      shalik. "have you finished? " sherborn asked pompously. "if you have, get
      off. I'm staying here. " "i'll be going in a few minutes, " she returned,
      not looking at him. Sherborn nodded, regarded her contemptuously and
      returned to shalik's office. Natalie sat for a long moment listening, then
      when she heard sherborn dialling a number, she took from a drawer a big
      plastic shopping bag. From another drawer she took out the tiny tape
      recorder and three reels of tape. These she hurriedly put in the shopping
      bag and zipped it shut. She could hear sherborn talking on the telephone.
      She moved silently to the door and listened. "i've got the place to
      myself, baby, " sherborn was saying. "yes . . . The whole weekend. Suppose
      you come over? We could have fun. " natalie grimaced with disgust and
      moved away. She put on her coat, tied a black scarf around her head and
      taking the shopping bag, she crossed to the lift and pressed the call
      button. As she waited, sherborn appeared in the doorway. "you off? " she
      stared bleakly as she saw him looking curiously at the shopping bag.
      "taking all the secrets with you? " "yes. "the lift doors swung open and
      she entered. As the doors closed, sherborn smiled sneeringly at her.
      Natalie took a taxi back to her two-room flat in church street,
      kensington. She had slept very little the previous night, tossing and
      turning, trying to make up her mind whether to betray shalik or not. Even
      now as she unlocked the front door and entered the small but pleasant
      living-room which she had furnished with care, she still hadn't made up
      her mind. She put down the shopping bag, took off her head scarf and coat
      and then dropped into an armchair. She sat there for some minutes, knowing
      she would do it and loathing herself. She looked at her watch. The time
      was 11:10 hrs. There was always the chance that burnett wouldn't be at the
      bank on this saturday morning. If he wasn't, then it would be a sign for
      her not to do what she was planning to do. For a brief moment, she
      hesitated, then crossed to the telephone and dialled a number. She sat on
      the arm of the chair as she listened to the ringing tone. An impersonal
      voice said, "this is the national bank of natal. " "could i speak to mr.
      Charles burnett, please? " "who is calling? " "miss norman . . . Mr.
      Burnett knows me. " "one moment. " there was a brief delay, then a rich,
      fruity baritone voice came over the line. "miss norman? Delighted . . .
      How are you? " she shivered, hesitated, then forced herself to say, "i
      would like to see you, mr. Burnett . . . It's urgent. " "of course. If you
      could come at once . . . I am leaving in an hour for the country. ""no! "
      hysterical self-loathing now had her in its grip. "in half an hour . . .
      Here . . . At my flat! 35a church street, fourth floor. I said it was
      urgent! " there was a pause, then the rich baritone voice, sounding
      slightly shocked, said, "i'm afraid that is not convenient, miss norman. "
      "here! In half an hour! " natalie cried, her voice going shrill and she
      slammed down the receiver. She slid down into the seat of the chair,
      resting her head against the cushion. Her body shuddered and jerked as she
      began to sob hysterically. For some minutes she allowed herself the luxury
      of crying. The hot tears finally ran no more. Trembling, she went into the
      bathroom and bathed her face, then spent some minutes repairing her
      make-up. She returned to the sitting-room, opened a cupboard and took out
      the bottle of whisky she kept for daz. She poured herself a stiff drink
      and swallowed it neat, shuddering. She sat down to wait. Thirty-five
      minutes later, the front door bell rang. At the sound of the bell, blood
      rushed into her face and then receded leaving her face chalk white. For a
      long moment, she sat motionless, then when the bell rang again, she forced
      herself to her feet and opened the door. Charles burnett, chairman of the
      national bank of natal, swept into the room like a galleon in full sail.
      He was a large, heavily-built man with a purple red face, shrewd hard eyes
      and his bald head, fringed by glossy white hair, was glistening pink.
      Immaculately dressed in a savile row grey lounge suit with a blood red
      carnation in his button hole, he looked a movie version of what a rich,
      influential banker should be. "my dear miss norman, " he said, "what is
      all the urgency about? " he regarded her, his mind registering distaste,
      but he was far too shrewd andhe regarded her, his mind registering
      distaste, but he was far too shrewd and experienced to show it. What a
      dreadful hag! He was thinking: nice figure, good legs, of course, but that
      pallid face, the plainness of it, those depressing black eyes and the dark
      overshadowed face. Natalie had control of herself now. The whisky had
      given her false confidence. "sit down, please, mr. Burnett. I won't be
      wasting your time. I have information regarding mr. Kahlenberg that you
      will wish to hear. " burnett lowered his bulk into an armchair. His
      expression showed mild interest, but his shrewd mind was thinking: so it
      has paid off. One drops a seed here and there, and sometimes it
      germinates. As chairman of the national bank of natal which was owned by
      max kahlenberg, burnett was under instructions from his chief to collect
      every scrap of information circulating in london that could effect
      kahlenberg's kingdom in natal. Some twelve days ago, kahlenberg had sent
      him a brief cable: need information regarding activities of armo shalik.
      K. Burnett knew all about armo shalik, but nothing of his business
      activities. The cable dismayed him. To get information about shalik . . .
      The kind of information that would interest kahlenberg . . . Would be as
      difficult as getting information from the sphinx. However, burnett knew he
      had to do something about this request. When kahlenberg asked for
      information, he expected to get it no matter the difficulties or the cost.
      It so happened that two days later, shalik threw a cocktail party in his
      suite to which burnett was invited. Here, he met natalie norman. Burnett
      believed in being pleasant to the underlings. Didn't george bernard shaw
      say once: you may kick an old man: you know what he is, but never kick a
      young man: you don't know what he will become? Seeing natalie supervising
      the drinks and being ignored by the chattering guests, he had detached
      himself from his tiresome wife and cornered her. He had charm, and was an
      easy con versationalist and he quickly learned that this pale-faced,
      plain-looking woman was shalik's personal assistant, and he could see that
      she was sexually starved. Was sexually starved. He easily won her
      confidence and chatted with her for some minutes while his mind worked
      swiftly. She could be vitally important to him and he knew he couldn't
      remain with her for long as shalik was already glancing in their direction
      with lifted eyebrows. "miss norman, " he said quietly, "i am in the
      position to help people like yourself should you need help. Please
      remember my name; charles burnett, the national bank of natal. Should you
      ever get dissatisfied with your job here, should you wish to earn more
      money, do please contact me. " as her expression became bewildered, he
      smiled and left her. After returning home, he sat in his study and
      considered his next move. He hoped he hadn't rushed his fences with this
      pale-faced woman. She could be the spy he needed. Obviously, she needed
      physical contact with a virile man. Burnett knew all the signs: her
      thinness, her dark ringed eyes, her depressed expression. What she needed
      was a lusty bedmate: he decided this must be the first move to ensnare
      her. Burnett had many useful contacts and among them was ex-inspector tom
      parkins of the c. I. D. He telephoned him. "parkins . . . I am looking for
      a young rogue who could do a special job for me. He must be completely
      unscrupulous and good looking with personality and around twenty-five, not
      older. Do you know of anyone like that? " the cop voice said, "shouldn't
      be too difficult, sir. Would the pay be interesting? " "very. " "i'll turn
      it over in my mind, sir. Suppose i call you after lunch? " "do that, "
      burnett said, satisfied that he would get what he wanted. Around 15.00
      hrs. , parkins telephoned. "i've got your man, sir, " he said. "daz
      jackson: twenty-four years of age, excellent appearance, plays a guitar in
      a fifth rate soho club and needs money. He served two years for petty
      larceny three years ago. "he served two years for petty larceny three
      years ago. " burnett hesitated. "this might be a little tricky, parkins.
      I'm not letting myself in for blackmail? " "oh no, sir. Anything like that
      . . . And it won't happen, i assure you . . . I could handle for you. I
      have quite a lot on this young tearaway. You don't have to worry about
      that angle. " "very well. Send him here at 17.00 hrs. I'll arrange to have
      ten pounds credited to your account with us, parkins. " "that's very kind
      of you, sir. You will be quite satisfied with jackson. " daz jackson
      arrived ten minutes after the hour. He was ushered into burnett's vast
      office by burnett's secretary. She had worked so long for burnett that
      nothing surprised her . . . Not even daz jackson. Burnett regarded the
      young man as he lounged into the big room, a supercilious grin on his
      face. He wore mustard-coloured hipsters, a dark-blue frilled shirt and a
      gilt chain around his neck from which hung a small bell that tinkled as he
      moved. What a specimen burnett thought, but, at least, he is clean.
      Without being asked, jackson lowered his lean frame into a chair, crossed
      one leg over the other and regarded burnett with an insolent lift of his
      eyebrow. "the ex-bogey said you had a job. What's the pay? " he asked.
      "and listen, i don't dig to work in this graveyard. Catch? Burnett was
      used to dealing with all kinds of people and he was adaptable. Although he
      would have liked to have kicked this young beatnik out, he saw he could be
      the man he was looking for. "i'm not asking you to work here mr. Jackson,
      " he said. "i have a"i'm not asking you to work here mr. Jackson, " he
      said. "i have a special job which you could handle and which pays well. "
      jackson raised a languid hand in mock protest. "skip the mister and all
      that jazz, " he said. "call me daz. " burnett's insincere smile became a
      little stiff. "certainly . . . But why daz? " "the chicks call me that . .
      . I dazzle them. " "splendid. " burnett leaned back in his executive
      chair. "what i want you to do is this . . . " he explained. Daz jackson
      lolled in his chair and listened. His ice grey eyes searched burnett's
      face while burnett talked. Finally, when burnett said, "well, that's it .
      . . Do you think you can handle it for me? " daz grimaced. "let's get it
      nice and straight, " he said, stretching out his long legs. "this piece
      wants to be laid . . . Right? " when burnett nodded, he went on, "once
      i've given it to her, she'll want more right? " again burnett nodded.
      "then she has to pay for it . . . You want me to squeeze her dry . . .
      Right? " "yes . . . That is the situation. " "you will pay me a hundred
      nicker for doing the job and what i get out of her i keep . . . Right? "
      burnett inclined his head. Dealing with a man like this made him feel
      slightly soiled. Soiled. Jackson leaned back in his chair and stared at
      burnett. "well, for god's sake, and they call me delinquent! " burnett's
      eyes turned frosty. "do you want the job or don't you? " they stared at
      each other for a long moment, then daz shrugged. "oh sure . . . What have
      i to lose? What's this piece like? " "plain but adequate, " burnett
      returned, unconsciously using the phrase in the michelin guide to france
      to describe a third rate hotel. "okay, so where do i find her? " burnett
      gave him natalie's home and business addresses typed on a blank card. "i
      want quick action. " daz grinned. "if you say she's thirsting for it,
      she'll have it and once she has had it from me, she'll want it again and
      again. " daz regarded burnett, his eyes calculating. "the cops won't come
      into this? " "there's no question of that. " "well, if they do, i'll
      squeal. I'm not mad about this job. " burnett stared coldly at him. Him.
      "but you will do it? " daz shrugged. "i said i would, didn't i? " "get as
      much money out of her as you can. I want her to be in an impossible
      financial position. I want her to be up to her eyes in debt. " daz dragged
      himself to his feet. "how about some money now . . . I'm skint. " "when
      you deliver, " burnett said curtly and waved a dismissal. In the bitter
      cold of a january night, natalie norman found her rear off-side tyre was
      flat. She had been working late, and was now looking forward to getting
      home and into a hot bath. She had parked her austin-mini, as she always
      did in a cul-de-sac off park lane. She stood shivering in the biting wind
      while she looked helplessly at the flat tyre, when out of the shadows,
      came a tall, lean young man, wearing a lamb skin lined short coat, his
      hands thrust deeply into the pockets of his black hipsters. Daz had
      learned where natalie parked her car, and he had let the air out of the
      tyre some fifty minutes ago. He had stood in a nearby doorway, freezing
      and cursing until he saw her come to the car. This was his first glimpse
      of her. He brightened considerably as the street light lit up her long,
      slim legs. The least he had expected was some woman with legs that could
      support a grand piano. He waited, watching her. She moved into the full
      light and he grimaced. Good body, but so obviously a plain, sex-starved
      spinster with as much personality as a drowned cat. Boy! He thought. Will
      i have to use my imagination to get her laid! "you in trouble, miss? " he
      said. "can i give you a hand? " natalie was startled by his sudden
      appearance. She looked helplessly to right and left, but there was no one
      in the cul-de-sac except themselves. "i have a puncture, " she said
      nervously. "it's all right. I'll get a taxi . . . Thank you. " he moved
      under the street light so she could see him. They regarded each other, he
      moved under the street light so she could see him. They regarded each
      other, and she felt her heart beat quicken. He was lean and tall and like
      a beautiful young animal, she thought. His hair, curling to his collar,
      excited her. She felt a rush of blood through her: something that often
      happened when she saw really masculine men on the street, but her pale,
      expressionless face revealed nothing of the feeling that was moving
      through her body. "i'll fix it, " daz said. "you get in the car, miss. Get
      out of the cold. Phew! It's cold, isn't it? " "yes . . . But please don't
      bother. I'll take a taxi. " "hop in . . . I'll fix it . . . Won't take me
      a jiff. " she unlocked the car door and got gratefully into the little
      car, closing the door. She watched his movements. He was very quick. Under
      ten minutes, he came to the car window, wiping his hands on the seat of
      his hipsters. "all fixed, miss . . . You can get off. " she looked up at
      him through the open car window. He leaned forward, staring down at her.
      Was there something of promise in his young eyes? She wondered. Her heart
      was jumping about like freshly landed trout. "can't i give you a lift? "
      she smiled and when she smiled, he decided she wasn't all that bad to look
      at. "you wouldn't be going near knightsbridge? " he asked, knowing that
      was where she lived. "oh yes . . . Church street. " "well, a lift would be
      nice. " he went around the car and slid in beside her. His shoulder
      touched her and she felt as if she had received an electric shock. She was
      furious with herself because her hand was shaking so violently she
      couldn't get the key into the ignition lock. Couldn't get the key into the
      ignition lock. "you're cold. Like me to drive, miss? " silently, she
      handed him the keys and he slid out of the car as she moved over to the
      passenger's seat. Her skirt got rucked up on the gear lever. She
      hesitated, then knowing her legs and slim thighs were her only attractive
      features, she let her skirt remain as it was. "i'm frozen, " she forced
      herself to say as daz got under the driving wheel. "me too . . . It's
      perishing. " she expected him to drive fast and flashily, but he didn't.
      He drove well, keeping just under the 30 m. P. H. Limit and with expert
      confidence that surprised her. "do you live in knightsbridge? " she
      ventured. "who . . . Me? " he laughed. "nothing so posh. I live in a rat
      hole in parson's green. I'm out of work. Whenever i get down to my last
      quid i like to walk around knightsbridge and window shop. I imagine what i
      would buy from harrods if i had a mass of lolly. " she looked at his
      handsome profile, and again she experienced this devastating pang of
      desire. "but why are you out of work? " she asked. "people need never be
      out of work these days. " "i've been ill. I've got a weak lung . . . Plays
      up sometimes . . . Then i get laid off. I've been laid off now for two
      weeks. " daz thought: the lies i can tell. I almost believe this myself.
      Then feeling he was laying it on a little too thick, he added, "i'll get
      something next week, i'm feeling fine now. " natalie digested all this.
      "i'm glad. " he turned and gave her a smile that had earned him his nick
      name. She felthe turned and gave her a smile that had earned him his nick
      name. She felt sloppily weak as her desire for him mounted. "you don't
      have to worry about me, miss. No one, including me, worries about me. " he
      paused, then went on, "you're out late, aren't you? " "i often work late.
      " "church street you said? " they were now driving by knightsbridge
      underground station. "yes. " "you live on your own? " oh yes, natalie
      thought bitterly. Alone . . . Always alone. "yes. " daz's eyes moved to
      her legs, exposed to above the knee. Poor cow! He thought. This is going
      to be easy. "well, tots of people live on their own, " he said. "when they
      get back from work, they shut themselves in their dreary rooms and that's
      it until they go out to work the next morning. That's why i like to walk
      the streets at night. Staying in my room on my own gives me the horrors. "
      "i can understand that. " then as he began to drive up church street, she
      went on, "this is the place . . . On the right. "well here's the crunch,
      he thought. Is she going to invite me in? "you mean this big block here? "
      "yes. You go down the ramp to the garage. " she hesitated then said in a
      small voice, "i expect you would like a wash after changing that tyre. I
      think you deserve a drink too. " he hid a grin. He had felt it would be
      easy, but not quite this easy. "yes. I could do with a wash, " and he
      drove the car down into the big lighted garage. They went up in the lift
      to the fourth floor. Neither of them looked at each other on the way up
      nor spoke. She unlocked her front door and led him into the small, bright
      sitting-room. "do take your coat off. " her voice was very unsteady. He
      looked around. "this is real nice. " she came to know nice was his
      favourite word. "the bathroom's through there. " she left him in the
      bathroom and she took off her coat and scarf, feeling desire for him
      raging through her. She was still standing in the middle of the room,
      white and shaking, when he came out of the bathroom. He knew at once there
      would be no trouble. We don't know each other. I'm daz jackson. " "i'm
      natalie norman. " "nice name . . . Natalie . . . I dig for that. "they
      stared at each other, then he moved close to her and slid his arms around
      her. She shivered as his hands moved down her thin back. For one brief
      moment, her subconscious mechanism fought to repulse him, but her need was
      too strong. She was only dimly aware of being carried into the bedroom.
      She relaxed on the bed moving a little from side to side as he stripped
      off her clothes. Then she gave herself up to his animal lust. Daz jackson
      opened his eyes and let out a long, slow sigh. Well, for shouting aloud!
      He thought as he looked up at the white ceiling. Who would have believed
      it. It's the best i've ever had! He turned on his side and looked at
      natalie who lay on her back, her hands covering her small breasts,
      sleeping. He regarded her body. Good, pity about that face. He gave her a
      gentle prod in the ribs. "wake up! I'm hungry. You got any food? " she
      stirred and looked up at him, her eyes glazed with a satisfaction she had
      never known before. She felt as if a hidden door she had long been
      searching for had suddenly opened and the sun and the breeze and the sound
      of the sea had come into the barren, dark cave in which she had lived for
      so long. "food . . . Of course. " she sat up, swung her legs off the bed
      and snatched up a wrap. "stay there . .. I'll get you something. Would you
      like a drink . . . I have only gin. " he regarded her. Her anxiety to
      please, the soft look in her eyes and her eager trembling made her a bore.
      "just grub. " she ran into the kitchen. He waited a moment, then got off
      the bed and struggled into his clothes. He saw by the bedside clock that
      the time was 02.25 hrs. He listened, smelling bacon frying, then he looked
      around the small neat room. He looked beyond the doorway, across the
      sitting-room and saw her standing by thelooked beyond the doorway, across
      the sitting-room and saw her standing by the stove in the kitchen, her
      back to him. Working quickly, he went through her chest of drawers. In the
      top drawer he found a gold cigarette case, a gold lighter and a small
      jewel box which contained a string of pearls and two rings of little
      value, but he took all of them, dropping them into his pocket. Then he
      lounged into the sitting-room and stood in the kitchen doorway. "smells
      nice, " he said. She turned and smiled at him. "can you eat more than four
      eggs? " "that'll be fine. " she hurried past him and quickly laid the
      table. "aren't you eating? " he asked, seeing she had set only one place.
      "no . . . It's ready. Sit down. " he ate hungrily. Well, she certainly
      could cook eggs and bacon, he thought as he sipped the tea she had poured
      him. Pity there weren't chips and tomato ketchup, but you can't expect
      everything. He was aware of her, sitting on the settee, watching him.
      There was that soft look in her eyes that told him she was hooked. When he
      had finished, he sat back, wiping his mouth on the paper serviette she had
      provided. "nice, " he said. "really nice. " "you were hungry, weren't you?
      " he stared directly at her. "yes . . . And so were you. " blood stained
      her face and she looked away. "nothing to turn hot about. " he smiled his
      dazzling smile. "it's nature. You liked it, didn't you? I'll tell you
      something: you were good . . . Really good. "it, didn't you? I'll tell you
      something: you were good . . . Really good. " "please don't talk about it.
      I've never done it before. " "so what? You have to start sometime. " he
      got to his feet. "well, i must be taking off. " he paused. "thanks for
      everything. It was real nice . . . All of it. " he watched her hands turn
      into fists. "wouldn't you like to to stay? " she said breathlessly. "it's
      such a horrid night. You can stay if you like. " he shook his head. "got
      to get back to my pad. " he began to move slowly to the front door. "i
      suppose we we could see each other again, " she said, her dark eyes
      desperate. Here it is, he thought. The hook. "you never know. Things
      happen, don't they? So long, " and before she realized he was really
      going, he had gone. The front door slammed. The sound was like a
      disastrous clap of thunder inside her head. It wasn't until the following
      evening that she discovered the loss of her cigarette case and lighter,
      given to her by shalik as a birthday present, and her pieces of jewellery.
      The discovery shocked her and she knew at once who had taken them. Her
      first reaction was to rush to the telephone to inform the police, but then
      she controlled her anger and sat down to think. He was out of work. He had
      been hungry. What did she need with a gold cigarette case or the lighter?
      She didn't smoke anyway. Thinking of him, she decided that he could have
      everything she owned so long as he came back to her. For five long,
      shattering days, she waited with growing desperation to hear from him
      again until finally a slow horror began to build up inside her that she
      would have to face the crushing fact that he had made use of her, stolen
      her things and had forgotten her. Had forgotten her. Then on the fifth
      night, as she sat miserably alone in her flat, facing yet another long
      night of loneliness, the telephone bell rang. Her heart gave a great leap
      as she sprang to her feet and ran across the room to snatch up the
      receiver. "yes? " "this is daz . . . Remember me? " her legs felt so weak
      she had to sit down. "of course. " "look, i'm sorry i took your things.
      You mad at me? " "no . . . Of course not. " "well, it wasn't nice. I
      pawned them. I had to have money fast . . . Bit of trouble. I'll let you
      have the tickets . . . Shall i bring them round now? " "yes. " "okay,
      then, " and then line went dead. He didn't arrive until 22.05 hrs. ,
      giving her a frantic wait of an hour and a half. She thought he looked
      thinner and he wore a scowling frown that gave him a dark, sullen look.
      "here you are, " he said, dropping three pawn tickets on the table. "i
      shouldn't have done it . . . But i was in trouble . . . I had to raise
      money fast. " "it's all right. I understand. Are you hungry? " "no . . . I
      can't stay. I've got to go, " and he turned to the front door. She gazed
      at him in panic. "but you please stay. I want you to stay. "he turned on
      her, his eyes suddenly savage. "i've got to raise more money, " he said.
      "i can't fool around here. There's a girl living near my pad who is trying
      to raise something for me. I've got to see her tonight. " "a girl? "
      natalie turned cold. "daz . . . Won't you explain what this is all about?
      Won't you sit down? I could help you if you would explain. " "i've had
      enough out of you. " daz shook his head. "anyway, lola has practically
      promised . . . " "please sit down and tell me. " he sat down. It was easy
      to lie to her. The horse that was a cinch. The bet he couldn't cover, and
      now the bookie was after him. "they are a tough lot, " he concluded. "if i
      don't raise fifty pounds by tomorrow they are going to do me. " "do you? "
      natalie looked at him in horror. "what does that mean? " "carve me, of
      course, " he said impatiently. "slash me with a razor . . . What do you
      think? " she imagined that handsome face bleeding. The thought made her
      feel faint. "i can let you have fifty pounds, daz . . . Of course. " "i
      can't take it from you . . . No, i'll see lola. " "don't be silly. I'll
      give you a cheque now. " an hour later, they were lying side by side on
      the bed. Natalie was relaxed and happy for the first time since last she
      had seen daz. It had been wonderful, she was thinking, better even than
      the first time. She turned to look at daz and herwas thinking, better even
      than the first time. She turned to look at daz and her heart contracted to
      see that sullen dark look back on his face again. "what is it, daz? "
      "just thinking . . . Can't a man think, for god's sake? " she flinched at
      the harsh note in his voice. "wasn't it good for you? Did i disappoint
      you? " "i wasn't thinking about that. " he looked impatiently at her in
      the shaded light of the bedside lamp. "that's over. I'm thinking ahead.
      Just shut up a minute, will you? " she remained still, waiting and
      watching his hard young face and the way his eyes shifted, reminding her
      of an animal in a trap. "yes, " he said finally as if speaking his
      thoughts aloud. "that's what i'll do. I'll get out. I'll go to dublin.
      That's it! Danny will get me a job. " natalie sat up, clutching the sheet
      to her breasts. "dublin? What do you mean? " he frowned at her as if just
      aware she was with him. "what i say. I have to get out. That fifty quid
      you've given me will keep isaacs off my neck for a couple of days. By
      then, i'll be out of his reach. " she felt as if she were going to faint
      again. Watching her, daz saw he had played a trump card. "but you said if
      i gave you the money it would be all right, " she gasped. "daz! Tell me!
      What do you mean? "he looked scornfully at her. "you don't imagine a
      bookie would carve anyone for fifty quid, do you? I'm in the hole for
      twelve hundred. " once she had absorbed the shock, her trained mind
      searched for ways and means. Twelve hundred pounds! It was an impossible
      sum! She had taken an expensive autumn vacation, and she had only two
      hundred pounds to her credit at her bank. But the idea of daz leaving
      england and going to ireland was unthinkable. She slid off the bed and put
      on her wrap while daz watched her. He saw there was a change of expression
      on her face. He saw her mind was working, and he lay still, waiting
      results. He wondered uneasily if he had put the price too high, but
      burnett had told him to clean her out. Just suppose she hadn't the money?
      She walked around the room while she thought, then she came and sat on the
      bed, looking straight at him. "daz . . . If i give you twelve hundred
      pounds, could you remain in london? " "of course, but you can't give me
      that amount . . . So why talk about it? " "i can try. How long can you
      wait? " "why talk about it? " he lay on his back, staring up at the
      ceiling. "i must get out. I'll go tomorrow. " "how long can you wait? "
      her voice was now as harsh as his. "ten days . . . Not more. " "if i give
      you this money, daz, will you come and live here? " how easy it was to lie
      to this poor cow, daz thought. "you mean move in? You want me here? ""you
      mean move in? You want me here? " "yes. " she tried to control her voice.
      "i want you here. " "it would be nice . . . Yes, of course. I could get a
      job, and we could be together. But why talk about it? " "i think i can
      manage, " natalie threw off her wrap. She dropped down beside him on the
      bed. "you love me, don't you, daz? " that old jazz, he thought and pulled
      her to him. "you know i do. I'm crazy about you. " "then love me! " while
      daz slept by her side, natalie lay staring into the darkness, her mind
      busy. She knew it would be hopeless to ask shalik to lend her a thousand
      pounds. Even as she was telling daz that she thought she could get the
      money for him, she had been thinking of charles burnett of the national
      bank of natal. Natalie was well aware of the espionage and
      counter-espionage that goes on in present day big business. She knew
      burnett had been hinting that he would pay for information and she had
      treated the hint with the contempt it had deserved but now under pressure
      with the real risk of losing daz forever, she found she was much less
      scrupulous. Before dozing off, she made up her mind to contact burnett.
      Leaving daz sleeping, she had gone to the royal towers hotel the following
      morning. She quickly arranged shalik's mail on his desk, left a note to
      remind him of his various engagements for the day and then returned to her
      office. Various engagements for the day and then returned to her office.
      At this hour, she knew shalik was being shaved and dressed by the hateful
      sherborn. She hesitated only briefly, then called the national bank of
      natal. She was put through immediately to charles burnett who had already
      been alerted by daz by telephone what to expect. "of course, miss norman.
      I will be delighted to meet you again. When would it be convenient? " "at
      your office at 13.15 hrs. , " natalie told him. "then i will expect you. "
      when she arrived, burnett greeted her like a benign uncle. Natalie told
      him abruptly that she needed one thousand pounds. "it is a large sum, "
      burnett said, studying his pink finger nails, "but not impossible. " he
      looked up, his eyes no longer benign. "you are an intelligent woman, miss
      norman. I don't have to spell it out to you. You want money: i want
      information concerning mr. Shalik's activities that might have the
      remotest reference to mr. Max kahlenberg of natal. " natalie stiffened.
      During the past few days she had learned from scribbled notes on shalik's
      desk and from overhearing him talk to sherborn that something important
      was being planned that concerned a man named max kahlenberg who until this
      moment had meant nothing to her. All shalik's private correspondence was
      typed by sherborn. Natalie's job was to arrange shalik's appointments, his
      lunches and dinners and to act as hostess at his cocktail parties as well
      as taking care of the hundred and one personalhis cocktail parties as well
      as taking care of the hundred and one personal matters that made his life
      smooth and easy. "i don't think i can help there, " she said, dismay in
      her voice. "i'm excluded from mr. Shalik's business life, but i do know
      something is going on to do with a man called kahlenberg. " burnett
      smiled. "i can help you, miss norman. Your task will be absurdly easy. Let
      me explain. . . " twenty minutes later, she accepted a plastic shopping
      bag he had ready which contained a miniature tape-recorder, six reels of
      tape and a very special eavesdropping microphone. "the quality of the
      recordings, miss norman, will naturally influence the amount of money i
      will pay you. However, if you are urgently in need of a thousand pounds
      and providing you give me something of interest, the money will be
      available. " now, after eight days, he was here in her flat, his fat,
      purple face creased in a smile, his blood red carnation a status symbol.
      "my dear miss norman, what is all the urgency about? " during the past
      three days, burnett's microphone had eavesdropped. During the past eight
      days daz had slept with her, sweeping her into a world of technicolor
      eroticism. She had promised him the money and he was prepared to service
      her, telling himself that in the dark, all cats were grey. "i have
      information regarding mr. Kahlenberg which you will wish to hear, ""i have
      information regarding mr. Kahlenberg which you will wish to hear, "
      natalie said. The whisky she had drunk made her feel reckless and light
      headed. "splendid. " burnett crossed one fat leg over the other. "let me
      hear it. " "mr. Shalik is arranging to steal the caesar borgia ring from
      mr. Kahlenberg, " natalie said. "i have three tapes, recording the details
      of the operation and who are involved. " "the borgia ring? " burnett was
      surprised. "so he is after that? My congratulations, miss norman. Play me
      the tapes. " she shook her head. "i want one thousand pounds in ten pound
      notes before you hear the tapes, mr. Burnett. " his smile became fixed.
      "now, miss norman, that won't do. How do i know you even have the tapes? I
      must hear them . . . Let us be reasonable. " she had the tape-recorder
      already loaded and she let him listen to three minutes conversation
      between shalik and garry edwards, then as shalik was saying, "all that
      will be explained tonight. You will not be alone. The risks and
      responsibilities will be shared, " she pressed the stop button. "but
      nothing so far has been said about mr. Kahlenberg, " burnett pointed out,
      looking hungrily at the tape recorder. "when you have brought me the
      money, you will hear the rest, but not before. "they regarded each other
      and burnett saw it would be useless to try to persuade her. He got to his
      feet, reminding himself that one thousand pounds meant as much to max
      kahlenberg as one penny meant to the prime minister of england. Two hours
      later, his saturday afternoon ruined, burnett was back with the money. He
      listened to the tapes, his fat, purple face becoming more and more
      startled. He realized as he listened that he was getting these tapes
      cheaply. "splendid, miss norman, " he said as she wound off the last tape.
      "really splendid. You have certainly earned your fee. Any further
      information you can get like that i will, of course, pay you as
      handsomely. " "there won't be a next time, " natalie said. Her face was
      white and her expression of self-loathing startled burnett. She thrust the
      tiny tape recorder at him. "take it away! " "now, miss norman . . . "
      "take it! Take it! " she screamed and fearing a scene, burnett grabbed the
      recorder and the three tapes and hurriedly left. It was only on his way
      down in the lift that he realized she hadn't returned the expensive
      eavesdropping microphone. He wondered if he should go back for it, but her
      distraught face and the wild look in her eyes warned him not to. He would
      pick up the micro-, phone after the weekend when she would be calmer. Some
      three hours later, daz returned to the flat. He had already checked with
      burnett who had told him the money was waiting for him. Elated that he was
      going to lay his hands on such a sum, he had dated a chick to meet him at
      billy walker's boozer that was once an elegant restaurant and from there
      they would go to a club in king's road and from there into her bed. He was
      through with natalie. With a thousand pounds in hand and with his
      know-how, dublin would be the place for him. He was slightly startled when
      he entered the flat to find natalie sitting on the settee, white faced,
      trembling and crying. "what the hell's up? " he demanded, thinking how
      ugly she looked. She dabbed her eyes and straightened. She dabbed her eyes
      and straightened. "i have the money, daz. " he moved further into the
      room. "you have? What are you so miserable about? You oughta be pleased. "
      "judas wasn't pleased . . . He hanged himself. " daz had vaguely heard of
      judas. He wasn't sure who he was, but he had an idea he was a baddie and
      not a goodie. "what are you talking about? Who's hanging who? " "nothing .
      . . You wouldn't understand. Are you hungry? " he wiped his mouth with the
      back of his hand. "where's the money? " "you're not hungry? I've bought
      you a steak. " "to hell with the steak. Where's the money? " looking at
      him, she was shocked to see the greed on the lean, handsome face. She got
      unsteadily to her feet and went to a cupboard. She brought the money to
      him in neat stacks. It made her heart contract to watch him fondle the
      money. This couldn't be the man she loved so desperately who had opened
      the hidden door in her life: this was a greedy, vicious young animal who
      mauled the money as he had mauled her body. "are you pleased? "he ignored
      her and began stuffing the money into his various pockets. "what are you
      doing? " her voice went shrill. He stowed away the last packet of money
      and then regarded her. "getting the hell out of here . . . That's what i'm
      doing. " "you mean now you have the money, you you don't want me? " "who
      the hell would want you? " he pointed a finger at her. "i'm going to give
      you some advice. From now on, baby, keep your legs tightly crossed. That's
      your trouble. You dig your own grave, " and he was gone. Natalie stood
      motionless, her hand against her slow thumping heart. She listened to the
      lift descend, taking him out of her life forever. Then she walked slowly
      to a chair and sat down. She remained there as the hands of the clock on
      the wall moved around its face, marking the hours. Then when the light
      began to fade she eased her stiffness by stretching out her long, slim
      legs. Her mind began to work again. After all, she told herself, why
      should he care? I could have guessed what was going to happen. She closed
      her eyes. Now her lack of charm and her plainness was underlined as it had
      never before been so underlined. She realized all along she had been
      praying, waiting, hoping for a miracle, but this wasn't the year of
      miracles. She thought of the long, lonely nights ahead of her. She knew
      too that her conscience would be burdened by the guilt of her betrayal.
      She had done this disgusting act of disloyalty only to keep daz for
      herself. Why go on? She asked herself. You can't hope to live with
      yourself . . . So why go on? She went into the kitchen, moving slowly like
      a sleepwalker and found a small, sharp vegetable knife. Taking this with
      her, she paused to put the front door on the latch, then she went into the
      bathroom. She turned on the bath taps and stood in a black daze until the
      bath was half full of tepid water. She kicked off her shoes and stepped
      into the bath. Her pleated skirt ballooned out and she pressed it down.
      She felt the comforting water soak through her clothes to her despairing
      body. She lay still. Would it hurt? They said it was the easiest way to
      die. Gritting hershe lay still. Would it hurt? They said it was the
      easiest way to die. Gritting her teeth, she drew the sharp blade across
      her left wrist. She cut deeply and she fought back a cry of pain. The
      knife slipped from her hand. For a brief moment, she looked at the water
      surrounding her, now turning pink and darkening, then she closed her eyes.
      She lay there, thinking of daz with his handsome face and his long black
      curly hair and his beautiful strong body until she quietly slid away from
      a life she no longer had use for. Chapter four armo shalik returned to his
      suite at 08.30 hrs. On monday morning. He was met by sherborn who reported
      that fennel was in paris. He explained the circumstances while shalik sat
      at his desk, glowering at him. "i hope i did right, sir. Had i know where
      to contact you, i would, of course, have consulted you. " the fact that
      shalik had had an unsatisfactory week-end with a call girl somewhere in
      the country, and he had no intention of advertising this fact to sherborn,
      increased his rage. "well, he's gone. He said nothing about what he
      thought of the kahlenberg set- up? " "no, sir. He was in and out like a
      rocket. " shalik had a feeling this was going to be a black monday. Had he
      known that the three tapes, recording the details of his plan to steal the
      borgia ring had already arrived on max kahlenberg's desk, he would have
      considered this monday to be a disaster, but he didn't know. Irritated and
      short tempered, he presided over the 09.30 hr. Meeting, explaining to
      gaye, garry and ken jones that fennel had had to leave and was now in
      paris. "there is no need to go into details, " he said. "mr. Fennel left
      so hurriedly he was unable to tell me his opinion about kahlenberg's
      security measures. I trust he will be able to tell you when you all meet
      at the rand international hotel. As i have a busy morning, there is no
      useful purpose served in prolonging this meeting. " he looked at garry.
      "you have studied the maps i gave you? " "yes . . . No trouble, " garry
      said. "i'll get there. " "well, then the operation is now in your hands. I
      have done my best to make it easy for you. It is now up to you. You will
      be leaving tonight, and you will arrive at johannesburg tomorrow morning.
      " he paused, hesitated, then went on, "it is only fair to warn you that
      fennel is a dangerous criminal, but absolutely necessary if this operation
      is to succeed. " he looked directly at garry. "you appear able to take
      care of yourself, so i will ask you also to take care of miss desmond. "
      "that will be my pleasure, " garry said quietly. "oh, armo! " gaye said
      impatiently. "you know i can well look after myself. What are you fussing
      about? " "men fuss over beautiful women. I am no exception, " shalik said,
      lifting his fat shoulders. Again he looked directly at garry who nodded.
      "well, bon voyage and success, sherborn will give you your tickets and all
      the necessary details. " when the three had gone, shalik looked for his
      list of appointments which natalie always left on his desk. He couldn't
      find it. Again, he had a feeling that this monday was going to be more
      than tiresome. Angrily, he went into her room. That she was not sitting at
      her desk as she had always sat for the past three years startled him. He
      looked at his watch. The time was 10.00 hrs. Returning to his office, he
      rang for sherborn. "where is miss norman? " "i have no idea, sir, "
      sherborn returned indifferently. Shalik glared at him. "then find out! She
      may be ill. Call her flat! " the buzzer of the telephone sounded.
      Impatiently, shalik waved to sherborn to take the call. Sherborn picked up
      the receiver and said in his pompous voice, "mr. Shalik's residence. "
      there was a pause, then in a voice suddenly off-key, he said, "who? What
      did you say? " shalik looked angrily at him, then stiffened for sherborn
      had lost colour and there was alarm in his eyes. "hold on. ""what is it? "
      "sergeant goodyard of the special branch is asking to speak to you, sir. "
      the two men looked at each other. Shalik's mind flew to those three
      dangerous currency transactions he had recently made when he had moved
      some nine hundred thousand pounds out of england. Could scotland yard have
      possibly got on to that? He felt his hands turn moist. Steadying his voice
      and not looking at sherborn, he said, "tell him to come up. " three
      minutes later, sherborn opened the door of the suite to be confronted by a
      large, heavily-built man with probing eyes, a mouth like a fly trap and a
      jaw like the prow of a ship. "come in, sir, " sherborn said, stepping
      aside. "mr. Shalik will see you immediately. " sergeant goodyard moved
      into the room. He stared at sherborn, then lifted heavy eyebrows. "why,
      hello george . . . I thought you were dead. " "no, sir, " sherborn said,
      sweat on his face. "a pity. You keeping out of trouble? " "yes, sir. "
      sergeant goodyard surveyed the outer room with a critical eye. "you've
      found a nice little nest here, haven't you, george? Better than
      pentonville i dare say. " "yes, sir. " sherborn opened the door to
      shalik's office. After staring at him for a long moment, goodyard walked
      into the impressively luxurious room. Shalik glanced up. He regarded the
      police officer as he came slowly to the desk. "sergeant goodyard? " "yes,
      sir. " shalik waved him to a chair. "sit down, sergeant. What is it? "
      goodyard settled himself in the chair and looked stonily at shalik who
      felt the unease that all guilty people feel when under police scrutiny,
      although his face remained expressionless. "i believe miss natalie norman
      works for you? " surprised, shalik nodded. "that is right. She hasn't come
      in this morning. Has something happened to her? " "she died saturday
      night, " goodyard told him in his flat, cop voice. "suicide. " shalik
      flinched. He had a horror of death. For some moments he remained
      motionless, then his quick, callous mind became alive. Who was he going to
      find to replace her? Who was now going to look after him? The fact that
      she was dead meant nothing to him. The fact that he had relied on her for
      the past three years to arrange his social and business life meant a lot.
      "i'm sorry to hear that. " he reached for a cigar and paused to clip the
      end. Was there any reason? " what a bastard! Goodyard thought, but his cop
      face revealed none of his disgust. "that is why i am here, sir. I hoped
      you could tell me. " shalik lit the cigar and let the rich smelling smoke
      roll out of his mouth. He shook his head. "i'm sorry, but i know nothing
      about miss norman . . . Nothing at all. I have"i'm sorry, but i know
      nothing about miss norman . . . Nothing at all. I have always found her an
      efficient worker. She has been with me for three years. " he leaned back
      in his executive chair and looked directly at goodyard. "i am a busy man,
      sergeant. It is impossible for me to take much if any interest in the
      people who work for me. " goodyard felt in his overcoat pocket and
      produced a small object which he laid in front of shalik on the white
      blotter. "would you know what that is, sir? " shalik frowned at the thick
      paper clip: the kind that is used to clip together heavy legal documents.
      "obviously a paper clip, " he said, curtly. "i hope you have reason for
      asking me such a question, sergeant. You are taking up my valuable time. "
      "oh, yes, i have a reason, " goodyard was unperturbed by shalik's sharp
      note. "i understand, mr. Shalik, that you are engaged in many transactions
      about which rival companies could be interested. " shalik's face hardened.
      "surely that is no business of yours? " "no, sir, but it could explain
      this object here, " and goodyard tapped the paper clip. "just what do you
      mean? " "this apparent paper clip is a highly sensitive microphone which
      is illegal to possess and which is used only by authorized bodies. In
      other words, sir, this gadget is only used in espionage work. " shalik
      stared at the paper clip, feeling a sudden rush of cold blood up his
      spine. "i don't understand, " he said. "this paper clip was found in miss
      norman's flat, " goodyard explained. "fortunately the district detective
      investigating her death was smart enough to recognize what it was. It was
      passed to the special branch. That is why i am here. " shalik licked his
      dry lips as he said, "i know nothing about it. " "have you seen it before?
      ""i don't think so . . . How can i tell? " controlling a feeling of panic,
      shalik waved to a pile of documents on his desk, each held together with
      big paper clips, but none quite as big as the clip lying on his blotter.
      "it is possible . . . I don't know. " "to use this microphone
      successfully, " goodyard said, picking up the microphone and putting it in
      his pocket, "a special taperecorder is required. Could i examine miss
      norman's desk? " "of course. " shalik got to his feet and led the way into
      natalie's office. "that is her desk. " goodyard's search was quick and
      thorough. He also looked into the many filing cabinets and into the closet
      where natalie used to hang her coat. "no . . . " he turned to shalik.
      "have you any reason to believe that miss norman was spying on you? "
      "certainly not. " "you know nothing about her private life? I understand
      she had a young man living with her. Several people in her building have
      seen him entering her flat. Would you know who he is? " shalik's face
      showed his astonishment. "i can scarcely believe that . . . Still, if you
      say so. No, i know nothing about her. " "further inquiries will be made,
      sir. I shall want to see you again. " "i am usually here. " goodyard made
      for the door, then paused. "i don't know if you are aware that your
      servant is george sherborn who has served six years for forgery. "
      shalik's face was expressionless. "yes, i know. Sherborn is a reformed
      character. I am very satisfied with him. ""yes, i know. Sherborn is a
      reformed character. I am very satisfied with him. " goodyard's bleak, cop
      eyes stared at him. "do they ever reform? " he asked and left. Shalik sat
      down at his desk. He took out his handkerchief and wiped his damp hands
      while he thought. Had the microphone ever been on his desk? Suppose it
      had? Had that white faced bitch been recording his transactions? He
      thought of the dangerous currency deals. Then there was the information
      given him by the p. A. To the chancellor of the exchequer which had netted
      four of his clients fortunes. There was the merger leak he had got from a
      typist frantic for money. The list was endless. If she had planted the
      microphone on his desk, how many of his deals had been taped? There was
      also the kahlenberg affair. Had she recorded that? He screwed his
      handkerchief into a ball, his face vicious. Where was the taperecorder?
      Maybe, he thought, someone had got at her and she had only been
      halfconvinced. Maybe, he thought, she had taken the microphone and had
      second thoughts about taking the taperecorder. She could have felt soiled.
      She was a neurotic type. Maybe she had decided to kill herself rather than
      to betray him. But, suppose she had recorded the conversation he had had
      with the four who were going after the borgia ring? Suppose the tapes were
      already on their way to kahlenberg? He leaned back in his chair, staring
      at the opposite wall while his mind worked swiftly. Should he warn them?
      He considered the risk. The three men were expendable. He would be sorry
      to lose gaye desmond. He had taken a lot of trouble to find her, but,
      after all, he told himself, gaye wasn't the only woman in the world. If he
      did warn them that the operation might already be blown, wouldn't they
      back out? His fee for regaining the ring was to be $500,000 plus expenses.
      He grimaced. It was too large a sum to give up because of four people. In
      a situation like this, he told himself, he must keep his nerve and gamble
      that this dead bitch hadn't recordedhimself, he must keep his nerve and
      gamble that this dead bitch hadn't recorded what was said. After more
      thought, he decided to say nothing and to wait. He reached for his mail
      and because he had a trained mind, a few minutes later, he had completely
      dismissed goodyard's visit and had dismissed the thought that kahlenberg
      could know that he was to lose the borgia ring. Charles burnett sailed
      majestically into his office. He had lunched well on smoked salmon and
      duck in orange sauce and was feeling well fed and satisfied with himself.
      His secretary handed him a coded cable, telling. Him it had arrived a few
      minutes ago. "thank you, miss morris, " burnett said, stifling a small
      belch. "i'll attend to it. " he sat down at his desk and unlocked a
      drawer. From it he took kahlenberg's code book. A few minutes later, he
      was reading: pleased. Visitors will receive exceptionally warm welcome.
      Have bought 20,000 honeywell for your swiss account. K. Burnett asked miss
      morris to give him the day's quotation on honeywell. She told him the
      share had moved up three points. Burnett was feeling extremely satisfied
      when ex-inspector parkins came on the line. "i thought you should know,
      sir, that mr. Shalik's secretary, natalie norman, was found dead in her
      flat this morning . . . Suicide. " burnett was unable to speak for some
      seconds. "are you there, sir? " he pulled himself together. So he had been
      right: she had looked mental: he had been sure of it. "why should you
      imagine, parkins, that i could be interested? " he asked, trying to keep
      the quaver out of his voice. "well, sir, this young tearaway, daz jackson
      was seeing a lot of her. I thought possibly you should be told, but if i
      have made a mistake, then i apologize. " burnett drew in a deep, slow
      breath. "so jackson visited her . . . Very odd. Will he be involved? " "i
      doubt it. Jackson left for dublin on saturday night. The police do have
      his description. Still, dublin is a good place for him to be. " "yes.
      Well, thank you, parkins . . . Interesting. " burnett could almost see
      parkins' foxy face and the expectant hope in his little eyes. "there will
      be an additional credit in your account, " and he hung up. He sat for a
      long moment, thinking. He remembered the expensive microphone left in
      natalie's flat. For some seconds, he worried about it, then he assured
      himself no one would recognize it and it would be thrown away with her
      other rubbish. Parkins' call, however, had spoilt his afternoon. The lobby
      of the rand international hotel was crowded with large, noisy american
      tourists who had just arrived off a bus from which assorted luggage was
      already spewing. Wrapped in transparent raincovers, they milled around,
      shouting to each other, completely oblivious to the uproar they were
      creating. The lobby was shattered by cries of: "joe . . . You seen my bag?
      " "goddamn this rain . . . Where's the sun? " "for god's sake, martha,
      you're only exciting yourself. The luggage isn't all out yet. " "hey,
      momma . . . The guy wants our passports! " and so on and so on. America
      had taken over the rand international for some ear splitting moments while
      the white and the coloured staff coped with the invasion. Sitting near the
      breakfast-room with a view of all this commotion, lew fennel watched
      sourly. Rain fell steadily. The bantus, sheltering under umbrellas, paused
      to stare through the glass doors of the hotel at the confusion going on in
      the lobby. Having stared, they grinned and moved on, splay footed, the men
      in shabby european dress, the women wearing bright scarves over their
      heads and bright dresses that set off their colour. Fennel sucked at his
      cigarette and watched the last of the american party, still screaming to
      each other, whisked away in the lifts. He had been in johannesburg now for
      thirty-six hours. He had had a nervous half day in paris before catching
      the plane to south africa. Now, for the first time for over a month, he
      felt relaxed and safe. Moroni and the police were far away. He looked at
      his watch, then shifted his heavy body more comfortably in the chair. A
      black cadillac drew up outside the hotel and fennel got to his feet as he
      saw gaye's tawny head emerge as she ran under the cover of the hotel's
      canopy. Ten minutes later, the three were with him in the small
      sitting-room of his suite on the eighth floor of the hotel. Fennel was in
      an amiable and expansive mood. "i guess you all want to rest, " he said as
      he served drinks from the refrigerator, "but before you go, i'd like to
      fill you in with what we can expect . . . Okay? " garry eased his heavy
      shoulders. The fourteen hour flight had cramped his muscles. He looked at
      gaye. "do you want to listen or do we take a bath first? " "we listen, "
      gaye said, leaning back on the settee. She took a sip of the gin and tonic
      fennel had given her. "i'm not all that dead. " fennel's eyes narrowed. So
      edwards was already taking a proprietory interest in the woman he had
      mentally reserved for himself. "well, make up your minds! " he said, his
      temper rising. "do you or don't you want to hear? " "i said yes, " gaye
      said, her cool eyes surveying him. "what is it? ""i said yes, " gaye said,
      her cool eyes surveying him. "what is it? " "those invoices shalik gave
      me. It puts us right in the photo. " fennel drank a little of his whisky
      and water. "i now know the museum must be underground. A lift complete
      with all the works was delivered to kahlenberg's place and as the house is
      on one floor, the answer to the lift is the museum is under the house. Get
      it? " "keep going, " garry said. "listed in the invoices are six
      television close-circuit sets and one monitor. That tells me there are six
      rooms in the museum and there is one guard watching the monitor, probably
      somewhere in the house. By pressing buttons, the guard can survey each of
      the six rooms, but only one at the time. " fennel lit a cigarette, then
      went on, "i know this system. The weakness is that the guard could fall
      asleep, he could read a book without watching the monitor or he could
      leave to go to the toilet. But we must find out if he does all or any of
      these things and if he is on duty at night. That's your job to find out, "
      and fennel pointed his stubby finger at garry. Garry nodded. "the door to
      the museum is listed on the invoice. It is of massive steel. I worked for
      bahlstrom so i know about their equipment. The door has a time lock on it.
      You set it at a certain time and set the counter dial at another time and
      no one on earth except bahlstroms can open the door between these two
      times. " fennel grinned. "except me. I know how to handle that time lock.
      I helped to build it. Now we come to something you will have to take care
      of. " he was talking directly at garry. "the lift . . . This is a tricky
      one. We will do the job at night. What i want to know is if the lift is
      out of action during the night. By that, i mean is the electricity cut. If
      the lift doesn't work at night i don't see how the hell we are getting to
      the museum. " "let's be pessimistic, " garry said. "suppose the juice is
      cut off? " "it's up to you to turn it on or we're sunk. " garry grimaced.
      Garry grimaced. "there's always the chance there could be stairs as well
      as the lift. " "could be. " fennel nodded. "that too you have to find out.
      It's your job to find out as much as you can once you're in. Another thing
      you will have to tell me is how i get in . . . Door or window? Again this
      is up to you. All the dope you collect you give to me over the two-way
      radio so i'll know what to be ready for. " "if the dope can be got, i'll
      get it. " fennel finished his drink. "if you don't get it, we don't do the
      job . . . It's as simple as that. " gaye got to her feet. She looked
      sensationally lovely in the sky blue cotton dress she was wearing: a dress
      that clung to her figure. The three men watched her. "well, i'll leave you
      and take a tub. I want some sleep. I didn't sleep a wink on the plane. "
      she nodded to them and left the room. Garry stretched and yawned. "me too
      . . . Unless you want me for anything else? " "no. " fennel looked at ken.
      "how about the equipment? Have you got that lined up? " "i think so. I'll
      take a bath and go check. A friend of mine is organizing it for me. I sent
      him a cable from london telling him what we want. I'll go over there and
      see how far he's got. Do you want to come with me? " "why not? Okay, i'll
      wait here for you. " garry and ken went along the corridor to their rooms.
      They were all on the eighth floor: each had a small suite with an air
      conditioner and a view of the city. "well, see you, " garry said, pausing
      at his door. "this could be a tricky one. " ken grinned. Garry had now
      learned that ken was an incurable optimist. "you never know . . . Could
      work out fine. Me for the tub, " and he went off"you never know . . .
      Could work out fine. Me for the tub, " and he went off whistling to his
      room. An hour later, he returned to fennel's room. Fennel had been
      punishing the whisky and looked a little flushed. "shall we go? " ken
      asked, leaning against the doorway. "yeah. " fennel got to his feet and
      the two men walked along the corridor to the lifts. "this pal of mine runs
      a garage on plein street, " ken said as the lift descended. "it's just
      across the way. We can walk. " they pushed their way through another
      consignment of american tourists who had just arrived. The noise they were
      making made both men wince. "what makes an american so noisy? " ken asked
      good humouredly. "do they imagine everyone around is stone deaf? " fennel
      grunted. "i wouldn't know. Maybe they weren't taught as kids to keep their
      goddamn traps shut. " they paused under the canopy of the hotel and
      surveyed the rain sweeping bree street. "if it's going to rain like this
      in the drakensberg range we're in for a hell of a time, " ken said,
      turning up his jacket collar. "come on . . . May as well start getting wet
      . . . It'll be good practice. " their heads bent against the driving rain,
      the two men walked briskly across to plein street. Sam jefferson, the
      owner of the garage, a tall, thin elderly man with a pleasant, freckled
      face greeted them. "hi ken! Had a good trip? " ken said the trip was fine
      and introduced fennel. Jefferson lost some of his sunny smile as he shook
      hands. He was obviously a little startled at the cold, hard expression on
      fennel's face. Fennel wasn't his kind of people. "i got all the stuff and
      it's there laid out for you, " he went on turning to ken. "take a look. If
      there's anything i've forgotten, let me know. Excuse me now. I've got a
      gear box in my hair. " nodding, he went off across the big garage to where
      two bantus were staring vacantly at a jacked up pontiac. Ken led the way
      to a small, inner garage where a land rover was parked. A bantu, sitting
      on his haunches and scratching his ankle got slowly to his feet and gave
      ken a wide, white toothy grin. "all okay, boss, " he said, and ken shook
      hands with him. "this is joe, " he said to fennel. "sam and he have
      collected all the stuff we need. " fennel had no time for coloured people.
      He glowered at the smiling bantu, grunted and turned away. There was an
      awkward pause, then ken said, "well, joe, let's see what you've got. " the
      bantu crossed to the land rover and pulled off the tarpaulin that covered
      the bonnet. "i got it fixed like you said, boss. " welded to the front of
      the radiator was a drum between two steel supports. Around the drum was
      wound a long length of thin steel cable. Ken examined it, then nodded his
      satisfaction. "what the hell's that for? " fennel demanded, regarding the
      drum. "it's a winch, " ken explained. "we're going over some very sticky
      roads and we could easily get bogged down. When there's heavy rain, the
      roads over the drakensberg can be hell. This winch will drag us out
      without us breaking our backs. " he found a small yacht anchor lying on
      the floor of the land rover. "see this? We get stuck, and all we have to
      do is to slam this anchor into a tree root and winch ourselves out. " "the
      roads going to be that bad? " "brother! You have no idea. We have quite a
      trip ahead of us. Fennel scowled. Fennel scowled. "those other two have it
      the easy way . . . Flying in, huh? " "i don't know so much about that. If
      one of the fans falls off, they land in the jungle and that will be that.
      I'd rather drive than fly in this country. " "boss . . . " joe, still
      smiling, but uncomfortable in fennel's presence, pulled off a tarpaulin
      that covered a long trestle table standing away from the land rover. "you
      want to check this stuff? " the two men moved over to the equipment laid
      out. There were four jerrycans for water, another five for gas, four
      sleeping bags, four powerful electric torches with spare batteries, two
      six foot steel perforated strips for getting out of mud, a collapsible
      tent, two wooden cases and a large carton. "with luck, i reckon we'll take
      five days in and four days out to do the job, " ken said, patting the two
      wooden cases. "we have enough canned food to last us that time. " he
      tapped the carton. "that's booze: four scotch, two gin and twenty-four
      quarts of beer. I have a springfield, a 12 bore and a .22. There's plenty
      of game where we are going. You like guinea-fowl? Impala? Ever tried a
      saddle of impala done over a slow fire and served with chilli sauce? " he
      grinned and rolled his eyes. "it's marvellous! " "how about medical
      supplies? " fennel asked. "in the land rover . . . Complete medical chest.
      I took a safari first-aid course a while ago. I can handle anything from a
      snake bite to a broken leg. " "looks like you've taken care of it all. "
      fennel lit a cigarette and let smoke drift down his nostrils. "then all we
      have to take is our own personal kit? " "that's it . . . We travel light .
      . . Just a change. " "i've got my tool bag. " fennel rested his fat back
      against the land rover. "it's heavy, but i can't do without it. " "well,
      so long as you can haul it. "fennel cocked his head on one side. "we
      drive, don't we? " "we might have to walk some of the way. Even with this
      winch the road up to kahlenberg's place could sink us and if it does, we
      walk. " "how about taking the nigger along? " "look, friend, drop that. "
      ken's face had hardened. "we don't talk about niggers here. We talk about
      natives. Bantus or noneuropeans but not niggers. " "who the hell cares? "
      "i do, and if we're going to get along, you will care too. " fennel
      hesitated then shrugged. "okay, okay, so what? What's wrong with taking
      the native, the bantu, the noneuropean bastard along with us to carry the
      goddamn bag? " ken regarded him, his dislike plain. "no. He could talk his
      head off when he gets back. I've a friend of mine who's joining us at our
      camp at mainville. He worked with me when i was on a game reserve. He's
      coming with us. He is a kikuyu and a marvellous tracker. Without him, we
      would never get there. He's out at kahlenberg's estate now finding a way
      through the guards and let me tell you there are around three hundred
      zulus guarding the estate, but i'll bet when we meet at mainville, he'll
      have found a way through them, but he doesn't carry anyone's stuff but his
      own. Just get that into your skull. " fennel squinted at him through his
      cigarette smoke. "what is he . . . Black? " "he is a kikuyu . . . That
      makes him coloured. " "a friend? ""one of my best friends. " ken stared
      hard at fennel. "if that's so difficult for you to believe let me tell you
      the bantus out here are damn good friends when you get to know them and
      damn good people. " fennel shrugged. "this is your country . . . Not mine.
      Suppose we go back to the hotel? This goddamn rain is giving me a thirst.
      " "you go on. I've got to settle up for all this stuff and get it loaded.
      Suppose we all have dinner together? There's a good restaurant next to the
      hotel. We can iron out anything that needs ironing out. We could get off
      tomorrow. " "okay . . . See you, " and fennel left the garage and headed
      for the hotel. Ken watched him go, frowning. Then shrugging, he moved over
      to where sam jefferson was working on the pontiac. They all met at the
      checkmate restaurant which is part of the rand international hotel a
      little after 20.30 hrs. As was her privilege, gaye was the last to arrive,
      wearing a lemon-coloured cotton dress and making every male eye in the
      restaurant stare at her with that hungry look males have for really
      beautiful women. Fennel eyed her as she slid into her chair and felt sweat
      break out down his fat back. He had known many women in his life, but none
      to compare with her. He felt a white hot surge of desire go through him
      and it so shook him that he purposely dropped his serviette so he could
      bend, grope for it while he forced the desire out of his face. "well, what
      are we going to eat? " garry asked. They were all hungry and chose sea
      food on the broche and breaded veal with french fry. "how's it been going?
      " garry asked ken. He was aware of fennel's tenseness and glanced at his
      flushed face, then looked away. "all under control. We have everything
      organized now. We could leave tomorrow if that suits you two. " "why not?
      " garry looked at gaye for confirmation and she nodded. "the sooner we're
      off, the easier for us it will be. The rains have started. There is a
      chance the rain hasn't reached drakensberg yet, but if it has, fennel and
      i will have quite a trip. So, if it's all right with you, we will leave at
      08.00 hrs. Tomorrow morning. We drive in the land rover . . . It won't be
      too comfortable as we're pretty loaded. We have around three hundred
      kilometres to our camp at mainville. " the sea food was served and when
      the waiter had gone away, ken went on, "mainville is about four hundred
      kilometres from kahlenberg's place. The chopper will be at mainville. The
      airlift won't take long unless anything goes wrong. You two will stay in
      camp for a day while fennel and i go on by road. Then you take off. We'll
      be in touch with you on the two-way radio. I've tested them . . . They're
      good. We'll reach mainville just after noon with luck. Fennel and i will
      start around 05.00 hrs. The following morning. You will take off around
      10.00 hrs. The following morning. You should arrive at kahlenberg's place
      in an hour or so. You don't want to be too early. How does it sound? "
      "sounds fine, " garry said. "and the chopper? How about service and gas? "
      "all that's taken care of. You'll have enough gas to take her in and bring
      her out. I have a guarantee she will be fully serviced. It's up to you to
      satisfy yourself she is okay, of course, but from what i've been told,
      she'll be there waiting for you and ready to go. " "what's mainville like?
      " gaye asked, laying down her knife and fork. Ken grinned. "a horse and
      buggy town. I have the camp organized five miles out of town in the bush.
      " they began eating the veal which they enjoyed. They discussed further
      details of the operation. Both gaye and garry were aware that fennel had
      little to say except to grunt over his food and keep looking at gaye. At
      the end of the meal, they had coffee while ken talked. He was an easy and
      interesting talker and he amused them. "you'll have fun driving to
      mainville, " he said. "i won't be going on the highway on the last lap and
      you'll see game . . . Warthogs, impala, waterbuck, vervet monkeys and so
      on. I'll give you the dope on them when we see them if you're interested.
      I was once a game warden on a swank reserve . . . Taking people around in
      a land rover to spot game. ""what made you give it up? " gaye asked. "i
      should have thought it was a lovely life. " ken laughed. "you would,
      wouldn't you? Nothing the matter with the animals, but the clients finally
      got me down. You can't expect to go into the bush and just find animals
      waiting for you. You have to be patient. There are days, especially in
      this season, when you can drive for miles without seeing a thing. The
      clients always gripe . . . Blaming me. After a couple of years i got fed
      up with it. There was one client who really bore down on me. Okay, he had
      no luck. It was the rainy season, and he wanted to photograph a buffalo.
      He had a thousand dollar bet with a pal back in the states that he would
      bring the photo back . . . No buffaloes. We drove for hours hunting for
      them, but no luck, so he took it out on me. " ken grinned. "i hauled off
      and busted his jaw . . . Got eighteen months in jail for it so when i came
      out, i quit. " fennel who had been listening impatiently, broke in, "well,
      i don't know what you two guys are going to do, but i'm inviting miss
      desmond to come along with me and take a look at the nightspots. " he
      stared directly at gaye, his face set. "how about it? " there was a slight
      pause. Garry looked quickly at fennel's flushed face and then at gaye who
      smiled, completely relaxed. "that is nice of you, mr. Fennel, but excuse
      me. If i'm going to get up so early, i need my sleep. " she got to her
      feet. "good night. See you all in the morning, " and she made her way,
      followed by male stares, out of the restaurant. Fennel sat back in his
      chair, his face pale, his eyes burning. "some brush-off, " he snarled.
      "who the hell does she think she is? " ken got to his feet. "i'll fix the
      bill and then i'm going to bed, " and he walked over to the cash desk.
      Garry said quietly, "take it easy. The girl's tired. If you want to go
      somewhere i'll come with you. " fennel didn't appear to hear. He sat
      there, his eyes slightly mad, his face now getting back some colour. He
      got heavily to his feet and walked out of the restaurant and to the lift.
      He was shaking with frustrated rage. All right, you bitch, he was thinking
      as the lift doors swung open. I'll fix you! Just let me get you alone for
      ten minutes and i'll fix you so goddamn fast you won't know what's hit
      you. He reached his room, slammed the door shut and tore off his clothes.
      He threw himself down on the bed, his nails biting into the palms of his
      hands, sweat running down his heavy jowls. For more than an hour, his lewd
      mind enacted the things he would do to her when he had her alone, but
      after a while, the erotic thoughts became exhausted and his mind began to
      return to normal. He suddenly remembered what shalik had said: you will
      leave gaye desmond strictly alone . . . Try something like that with miss
      desmond and i promise you interpol will receive your dossier from me. How
      had shalik found out about the three killings? Fennel moved uneasily on
      the bed. He reached for a cigarette, lit it and stared across the room,
      lit by the revolving sign across the way. He was suddenly back in hong
      kong, coming off a junk at wanchai's fenwick street pier. He had been on a
      smuggling trip with three of his chinese friends. They had unloaded a
      cargo of opium at chu lu kok island without any trouble and fennel had
      $3,000 in his hip pocket. He was due to fly back to england in ten hours.
      After being cooped up in the stinking junk for six days, he was in need of
      a woman. His chinese friends had told him where to go. He had walked along
      gloucester road amid rickshaws, the fast moving traffic, the fruit vendors
      and the crowds of noisy chinese until he had come to the brothel,
      recommended. The chinese girl was small, compact with heavy buttocks which
      fennel liked, but she was as animated as a side of beef. She acted merely
      as a receptacle for his lust and when the unsatisfactory union was over,
      fennel, with half a bottle of whisky inside him, dulling his senses,
      slept, but fennel only ever slept slightly below the level of
      unconsciousness. He had always led a dangerous life and had trained
      himself never to become entirely unconscious, no matter how much he drank.
      He came awake to find the girl, still naked, her ivory skin lighted by the
      street light coming through the uncurtained window, helping herself from
      his well stuffedcoming through the uncurtained window, helping herself
      from his well stuffed wallet. Fennel was off the bed and had hit her
      before he was fully awake. His fist smashed into her face, snapping her
      head back and she went down, his money falling from her small hand, her
      eyes rolling back. Fennel snarled at her, then began to collect the money.
      It was only when he had thrown on his clothes and had stuffed his wallet
      into his hip pocket that he realized something was wrong. He bent over the
      still body and a chill crawled up his spine. He lifted her head by her
      thick hair and grimaced as the head rolled horribly on the shoulders. His
      savage, violent blow had broken her neck. He looked at his watch. He had
      two hours before he took off for london. He left the room, shutting the
      door and walked down the stairs to where an old chinaman was seated at the
      desk to check clients in and out. He knew he would have to pay for his
      freedom. "i'm leaving by junk in twenty minutes, " he lied. "the whore's
      dead. What's it going to cost? " the yellow wrinkled face showed nothing:
      a parchment map of old age. "one thousand dollars, " the old man said. "i
      have to call the police in an hour, " fennel showed his teeth in a savage
      snarl. "old man, i could wring your neck . . . That's too much. " the
      chinaman lifted his shoulders. "then five hundred dollars and i call the
      police in half an hour. " fennel gave him the thousand dollars. He had
      been in hong kong long enough to know a bargain was a bargain. He had to
      have at least an hour to get clear and he had got clear. Lying in his bed,
      watching the reflected light making patterns on the opposite wall, he
      remembered the girl. If she had been more responsive, he wouldn't have hit
      her so hard. Well, he told himself without conviction, she had deserved
      what she had got. The male prostitute he had been unlucky enough to run
      into in a dirty, evil smelling alley in istanbul, also got what he
      deserved. Fennel had come off a ship to spend a few hours in the city
      before going on to marseilles. He had broughtto spend a few hours in the
      city before going on to marseilles. He had brought three kilos of gold
      from india for a man who was paying well: a fat, elderly turk who wanted
      the gold as a bribe. Fennel had done the deal, collected the money and
      then found a girl to spend the night with. Thinking about her now, fennel
      realized she had been smart. She had got him drunk and when the time came
      for them to share the hotel bed, he had been too drunk to bother with her.
      He had slept three hours, waking to find her gone, but at least she hadn't
      been a thief. Livid with frustrated rage, and nearly sober, fennel had
      started back to his ship. Here, in this sleazy alley, he had met a
      perfumed boy: handsome with liquid black eyes and a sly, insinuating
      smile, who had importuned him. Fennel had vented his rage on him, smashing
      his head against the wall, leaving a big red stain where the wall had been
      dirty white. A woman, peering out of her window, had seen the act of
      brutal violence and had begun to scream. Fennel got back to his ship, but
      it was only when the ship sailed that he considered himself safe. Fennel
      often lived with his ghosts. He kept telling himself that the dead had no
      part in his life, but they persisted in his mind. In moments like this,
      when he was sexually frustrated, and alone, his past violence kept on
      intruding. This third murder haunted him more than the other two. He had
      been hired by a wealthy egyptian to open a safe belonging to a merchant to
      whom the egyptian had given bonds as security for a big loan. Fennel
      understood these bonds were forgeries and they could be discovered at any
      moment: the job was urgent. He had got into the palatial house easily
      enough and had settled down in front of the safe to open it. The time was
      02.45 hrs. And the household was asleep. The safe was old-fashioned and
      fennel had trouble in opening it. As he finally got the safe door open,
      his tools scattered around him, the door leading into the room where he
      was pushed open. Fennel snapped off his torch, grabbed up a short steel
      bar with which he had been working and spun around. A shadowy figure stood
      in the doorway, then the light went on. A girl stood in front of fennel in
      a nightdress and dressing-gown. She was small, dark with large black eyes
      and an olive complexion. She could not have beendark with large black eyes
      and an olive complexion. She could not have been older than ten years of
      age in fact she was nine. She stared at fennel in terror and her mouth
      began to open to scream. He reached her in two swift strides and slammed
      the steel bar down on her head. In that moment of panic, he had had no
      hesitation about killing her. The blow, as he well knew, was lethal. She
      had seen him, and if he had merely stunned her, she could have given the
      police a description of him. He had snatched the bonds from the safe,
      bundled his tools together and had left. It was only when he got into his
      car that he saw blood on one of his hands and became fully aware of what
      he had done. Those big, terrified dark eyes often appeared in his dreams.
      From the newspapers the following day, he learned the child was a
      deaf-mute. He had tried to convince himself that she was better dead, but
      when he was alone and in bed, the picture of the child in her nightdress
      and the look of terror on her face as she tried to scream pricked at what
      remained of his conscience. He lay watching the red and blue light from
      the sign across the way, reflected on the ceiling until finally, he
      drifted off into an uneasy sleep. Chapter five max kahlenberg always woke
      at 05.00 hrs. It was as if he had an alarm clock inside his head. During
      the seven hours in which he slept, he might have died. He had no dreams
      nor did he stir until he opened his eyes to watch the sun rise over the
      magnificent range of mountains that lay beyond the huge picture window
      opposite his bed. The bed was enormous, set on a dais with a shell-shaped
      headboard done over in lemon-coloured silk. Within his reach was a set of
      push-buttons set in fumed oak. Each button controlled his method of
      rising. The red button opened and closed the lemon-coloured window drapes.
      The yellow button lowered the bed to the floor level so he could swing
      himself into his electrically propelled wheel chair. The blue button
      opened a hatch by his bedside through which his coffee tray came. The
      black button filled his bath automatically and at exactly the right
      temperature. The green button operated the tv monitor at the end of his
      bed, putting him in direct contact with one of his secretaries. Max
      kahlenberg came awake and touched the red button. The window drapes swung
      open and he viewed the sky, seeing the scurrying clouds and he decided
      rain couldn't be far off. He switched on the defused light concealed
      behind the headboard and thumbed the red button. He shifted himself higher
      in the bed as the hatch at his side slid up and a tray containing a silver
      coffee pot, a jug of milk, a container of sugar and a cup and saucer slid
      within his reach and the hatch closed. Lying in the enormous bed, max
      kahlenberg looked like a handsome movie star. His head was completely
      shaved. He had wide set, blue-grey eyes, a well-shaped nose and a big,
      humourless mouth with a thin upper lip. He always slept naked, and as he
      hoisted himself up, he revealed a deeply tanned, magnificently developed
      torso. He drank his coffee, lit a cigarette and then pressed the green
      button that connected him with one of his secretaries. The tv screen lit
      up and he saw miah, an indian girl, who did the early morning shift, reach
      for a pencil and pad. He regarded her with pleasure. He liked beautiful
      women, and made a point only of employing women who pleased his eyes. The
      girl, her thin dark face classically beautiful, her big eyes looking
      directly at him although she couldn't see him, said, "good morning, sir. "
      kahlenberg studied her, then said, "good morning, miah. Has the mail
      arrived? " "it is being sorted now, sir. " "i'll be ready to dictate in an
      hour. Have your breakfast, " and he snapped off the set. He then pressed
      the black button which would fill his bath and lowered the bed to floor
      level. He threw off the sheet covering him. At that moment kahlenberg
      turned from a fine looking, handsome athlete into a grotesque freak. No
      one except his mother and his doctor had ever seen his legs. They had
      never grown from the time he had been born. In comparison to his well
      developed torso, they were two ghastly looking appendages, perfectly
      formed, unable to support his weight and which he loathed with a
      bitterness and revulsion that not only completely spoilt his life but had
      made him dangerously mentally disturbed. No one was ever allowed into his
      bedroom while he was in it himself. It was only when he was dressed and in
      his chair which had a snap-on cover over his legs that he felt safe from
      prying eyes. He hoisted himself into the chair and ran it into the vast
      bathroom. An hour later, he emerged, bathed and shaved and having had a
      thorough work- out in the well-equipped gymnasium that led off the
      bathroom. He wrapped the lower part of his body in a cotton loin cloth,
      put on a white open neck shirt, snapped the cover over the chair and
      steered the chair into the long corridor that led to his office. Coming
      towards him was a fully grown cheetah. This was hindenburg, kahlenberg's
      constant companion. He stopped the chair and waited for the big cat to
      approach him. He rubbed the thick fur while the cat made a deep, throaty
      sound, then with a final pat, kahlenberg sent the chair on its way, with
      hindenburg following behind, and reaching a pair of double doors which
      opened automatically, he propelled himself into the room. Kahlenberg's
      office was vast with a window that ran the length of the view side of the
      room. Of the room. From his big desk, he had an uninterrupted view of his
      lawns, the banks of flowers, the distant jungle, the undulating grass
      covered hills dotted by the scattered rondavels of his zulus to the
      drakensberg range. His mail was on his desk marked with various coloured
      stickers, donating its priority. Before going to bed, he had made notes of
      various affairs that needed attention. He pressed the green button on his
      desk and when the tv monitor lit up and he saw miah seated at her desk, he
      began to dictate. An hour later, he had finished the previous day's notes.
      "that is all, miah. Is ho- lu there? " "she is waiting now, sir. " "i'll
      be ready for her in half an hour, " and he switched off the set. He went
      rapidly through the mail of some fifty letters, made quick decisions that
      would add to his already vast fortune, then lit up the monitor screen
      again. This time a flower-like vietnamese girl was at the desk, patiently
      waiting. He greeted her and began dictating. By 10.00 hrs. He had cleared
      his desk. He sat for some moments, relaxing, his fingers caressing
      hindenburg's head, then he flicked down a switch on the intercom and said,
      "come in, please. " there was a moment's delay, then a tap sounded on the
      door which swung open. Guilo tak, kahlenberg's personal assistant came in,
      shut the door and approached the desk. Guilo tak was a tall, thin man with
      a mop of jet black hair that emphasized his cadaverous complexion. His
      black eyes were sunk deep and burned feverishly in his skull-like face.
      Born of an italian mother and a czech father, he had shown astonishing
      talent for figures at an early age. He had obtained a job in a swiss bank
      and quickly proved himself a financial genius. When kahlenberg had asked
      one of the directors of the bank if he knew of a man suitable to be his p.
      A. , the director had no hesitation in recommending tak. Kahlenberg found
      him not only a financial genius but utterly ruthless, utterlykahlenberg
      found him not only a financial genius but utterly ruthless, utterly
      efficient and utterly loyal. For some considerable time, kahlenberg had
      been hiring expert art thieves to supply his museum. Considerable
      organization and discussions were needed and kahlenberg begrudged the
      time. He had hesitated whether to hand these machinations over to tak, and
      finally decided after some eighteen months, that tak could be trusted. Tak
      was now not only in charge of the museum, but also handled kahlenberg's
      portfolio, often making suggestions and pointing to opportunities which
      kahlenberg with his other occupations might have missed. "good morning,
      sir, " tak said with a stiff little bow. "sit down, " kahlenberg said,
      resting his elbows on his desk and staring at tak, thinking what an
      extraordinary looking man this was. "any news of the borgia ring affair? "
      "yes, sir. The three thieves concerned arrived at the rand international
      hotel a few minutes ago. Fennel arrived the day before yesterday. He came
      from paris. A garage owner, sam jefferson, has been buying their
      equipment. I have a list of it here if you wish to see it. I have also
      photographs of these people taken as they arrived at the airport. " he
      paused to give kahlenberg a quick glance before laying a large envelope he
      had brought with him on the desk. "you may find the woman attractive. "
      kahlenberg glanced at the blown-up photographs of the three men and laid
      them on the blotter but he sat for some moments studying gaye's
      photograph. Then he glanced up. "what do you know about her? " "all their
      dossiers are in the envelope, sir. " "thank you, tak. I'll see you later.
      " when tak had gone, kahlenberg picked up gaye's photograph and again
      studied it for several minutes, then he opened a drawer and put the
      photograph away. He read the four dossiers, studied the list of equipment,
      read that the camp was situated near mainville and a helicopter had
      arrived there the previous day. He put all the papers back into the
      envelope and locked it away. He sat staring with hooded eyes down at his
      blotter for a long time, then with a slight nod of satisfaction at the
      decision he had reached, he set his chair in motion and snapping his
      fingers at hindenburg, he propelled himself out into the garden
      andsnapping his fingers at hindenburg, he propelled himself out into the
      garden and along the broad path for a half hour's break. The big cat
      wandered by his side. Back at his desk at 11.00 hrs. , kahlenberg dealt
      until lunch time with more papers that had arrived. He lunched on a smoked
      trout with horseradish sauce and a coffee, then returning to his office,
      sent for tak again. "how much did i pay for the borgia ring? " he asked.
      "sixty thousand dollars. Mercial paid a quarter of a million. We got it
      very cheaply. Now mercial is paying shalik half a million to recover it.
      Absurd, but without it, his borgia collection is spoilt. " "i am inclined
      to let him have it back, " kahlenberg said, staring at tak who said
      nothing. He knew by now the way kahlenberg's mind worked. "it might be
      amusing, but it wouldn't do to let these four have it without working for
      it, would it? " tak inclined his head and continued to wait. "so why not
      let them arrive here? As you say the woman is attractive. It will be
      interesting to see if fennel who is supposed to be such an expert can
      break into the museum. Let us encourage them. I can leave the details to
      you. " "you want them to walk away with the ring, sir? " "we will make
      their entrance easy and their exit difficult, but if they can get it off
      the estate, then i think they would be entitled to keep it, but only if
      they can get it off the estate. " kahlenberg's eyes searched tak's face.
      "you understand? " "yes, sir. " "so we let them in and make it difficult
      for them to get out. If anything should happen to them, i suppose the
      crocodiles would welcome extra food. " tak's eyes narrowed. "is it your
      wish something should happen to them, sir? " "well, it would be awkward if
      they got into the museum and then got away to talk. We wouldn't want
      interpol here making inquiries. The vatican was particularly incensed at
      losing the bust of jupiter. How that rogue ever got it outparticularly
      incensed at losing the bust of jupiter. How that rogue ever got it out of
      the vatican has always puzzled me. No, it wouldn't do for interpol to know
      the museum is below ground. " "but there was some suggestion, sir, that
      you were returning the ring to mercial. " "yes . . . I will return the
      ring but not his operators. " tak didn't follow this, but he waited. "our
      zulus would welcome a manhunt for a change, i think? " "they can be relied
      on, sir. " "yes . . . They are very close still to the savage. That may
      not be necessary, of course. Our enterprising four could get lost. Still,
      let them be alerted. Arrange some sort of reward and insist on proof. "
      "yes, sir. " "i must admit such a hunt would amuse me. " kahlenberg's
      thinlipped mouth tightened. "when they have been hunted down and the ring
      returned to me, i will mail it to mercial. " he rubbed his jaw as he
      stared at tak. "we mustn't make a mistake. It would be dangerous if even
      one of them got away. What chances do you think they have against a
      hundred of my zulus and the jungle? " tak considered the problem, then
      shook his head. "no chance at all, sir. " "that's what i think. "
      kahlenberg paused, thinking of the photograph locked in his desk. "pity
      about the woman. " tak got to his feet. "is there anything else, sir? ""is
      there anything else, sir? " "yes . . . Let me have the borgia ring. " when
      tak had gone, kahlenberg flicked down a switch on the intercom and said,
      "send kemosa to me. " a few minutes later an old, bent bantu, wearing
      immaculate white drill came into the office. Kemosa had served
      kahlenberg's father and was now in charge of the native staff, ruling them
      with a rod of iron. He stood before kahlenberg, waiting. "is the old witch
      doctor still on the estate? " kahlenberg asked. "yes, master. " "i never
      see him. I thought he was dead. " kemosa said nothing. "my father told me
      this man has great experience with poisons, " kahlenberg went on. "is that
      correct? " "yes, master. " "go to him and say i want a slow working poison
      that will kill a man in twelve hours. Do you think he could supply a
      poison like that? " kemosa nodded. "very well. I want it by tomorrow
      morning. See he is suitably rewarded. " "yes, master. " kemosa inclined
      his head and went away. Kahlenberg pulled a legal document towards him and
      began to study it. A few minutes later tak came in carrying a small glass
      box in which, set on a blue velvet support, was the caesar borgia ring.
      "leave it with me, " kahlenberg said without looking up. Tak placed the
      box on the desk and withdrew. After reading the document and laying it
      down, kahlenberg picked up the glass box and leaning back in his chair, he
      slid off the lid and took out the ring. Box and leaning back in his chair,
      he slid off the lid and took out the ring. He took from a drawer a
      watchmaker's glass and screwed it into his eye. He spent some moments
      examining the ring before he found the minute sliding trap, covered by a
      diamond that gave access to the tiny reservoir that held the poison. They
      left the rand international hotel a little after 08.00 hrs. And headed for
      harrismith on the n.16 highway. They were all wearing bush shirts, shorts,
      knee stockings, stout soled shoes and bush hats around which was a band of
      cheetah skin. The men all eyed gaye as she climbed into the front seat of
      the land rover. The outfit set off her figure and suited her. Again fennel
      felt a stab of frustrated desire go through him. Ken jones took the wheel
      and garry and fennel sat on the rear bench seat. It was a tight squeeze
      for the four of them and their equipment. Each had brought along a
      rucksack containing their personal essentials and these were piled on the
      rear seat between the two men. The sky was grey and the atmosphere was
      close and steamy and they were glad when they had left the city and had
      got on to the open road. "this is going to be a pretty dull run, " ken
      said. "two hundred kilometres to harrismith, then we turn off the national
      road and head down for bergville. We'll get to mainville for lunch, pick
      up our guide and then we have thirty kilometres through jungle to the
      camp. That'll be fun: we're certain to see some game. " "who's looking
      after the chopper? " garry asked, leaning forward. "you haven't just left
      it in the jungle, have you? " ken laughed. "i hired four bantus to guard
      it. I know them . . . They're okay. It only arrived yesterday. You've
      nothing to worry about. " gaye said she was glad to leave johannesburg. "i
      didn't like it. " "i don't know anyone who does, " ken returned. "but
      you'd like cape town and go crazy about durban. " the three chatted
      together as the land rover ate up the miles. Garry noticed that fennel was
      sullenly silent. He sat forward with his heavy bag of tools between his
      feet and his little eyes continually eyeing gaye's back and the view he
      could get of the side of her face. Every so often they came upon a series
      of beehive shaped huts where they could see the bantus moving aimlessly
      about, and tiny boys guarding lean, depressed looking cattle and herds of
      goats. Gaye asked a stream of questions which ken answered. Fennel paid no
      attention to the chatter. All he could think of was to get gaye alone. He
      was confident, once he did get her alone, she would submit to him. He had
      no interest in black people and he wished ken would stop yakking. It was
      after 14.00 hrs. When they drove into mainville's town centre that
      consisted of an untidy square, shaded by magnificent flamboyant trees in
      full flower. To the left of the square was the post office. Next to it was
      a native store and across the way was a shop run by a dutchman who seemed
      to sell everything from a pair of boots to a bottle of cough mixture. The
      bantus, sitting under the trees, watched then curiously, and two or three
      of them waved languidly to ken who waved back. "you seem to be a known
      character around here, " gaye said. "oh, sure. I get around. I like these
      guys and they remember me. " ken drove around the square and headed for a
      large dilapidated garage. He drove straight in. Two bantus came over and
      shook hands with him as he left the land rover. Ken spoke to them in
      afrikaans and they nodded, beaming. "okay, folks, " he said turning to the
      others. "we can leave it all here and go to the hotel for lunch. I could
      eat a buffalo. " "you mean they won't steal any of this stuff? " fennel
      asked. "you mean they won't steal any of this stuff? " fennel asked. Ken
      regarded him, his mouth tightening. "they're friends of mine . . . So they
      won't steal any of the stuff. " fennel climbed down from the land rover.
      "well, if you're sure about that. " the other three walked out into the
      blinding sunshine. Since leaving johannesburg the sun had come out and it
      was hot. The hotel was plain but decent and ken got a good welcome from a
      fat, sweating indian who beamed at the other three. "seen themba? " ken
      asked as they walked into the big diningroom. "yes, mr. Jones. He's
      around. Said he would be here in half an hour. " they all had a good
      chicken curry lunch, washed down with beer. From their table, they could
      see across the square to the garage and fennel kept looking suspiciously
      at the garage. "they're not stealing anything! Ken said sharply. He had
      become exasperated by fennel's suspicion. "can't you enjoy your lunch, for
      god's sake? Fennel squinted at him. The stuff in that tool bag is worth a
      lot of lolly, " he said. It's taken me years to collect. Some of those
      tools i've made myself. I'm making sure no goddamn blackie steals it. "
      seeing ken's face flush with anger, gaye broke in to ask about the hotel.
      The tension eased a little, then ken got to his feet. "i'll fix the bill,
      then go look for themba. ""is he our guide? " gaye asked. "that's right. "
      "and another black friend of his, " fennel said with a sneer. Ken
      hesitated, then walked away. Garry said, "wouldn't it be an idea if you
      tried to be pleasant for a change? Right now, you act as if you have a
      boil on your ass. " fennel glowered at him. "i act the way i like, and no
      one stops me! " "plenty of time to squabble when the job's done, " gaye
      said quietly. "be nice, mr. Fennel. " he glowered at her, got up and
      walked out of the restaurant. Gaye and garry paused to congratulate the
      fat indian on his curry, and then followed fennel across the square to the
      garage. "he's sweet, isn't he? " gaye said softly. "he's a fat slob. If he
      goes on like this, he'll get a poke in his snout! " "remember what armo
      said . . . He's dangerous. " garry scowled. "so am i. It bothers me that
      ken has to travel with him. " but he was less bothered when he saw a tall,
      magnificently built bantu, wearing bush clothes with a bush hat pinned up
      australian fashion on one side, shaking hands with ken. "that must be
      themba. Well, ken and he can take care of fennel; that's for sure. "sure.
      " ken made the introductions. Whereas garry and gaye shook hands, fennel
      just stared at the big bantu and then walked over to the land rover to
      make sure his bag of tools was still there. "themba only talks afrikaans,
      " ken explained. "so conversationally he's a dead loss to you two. " "i
      think he looks wonderful, " gaye said admiringly. "he's great. We've
      worked together for five years . . . No better tracker in natal. " they
      climbed into the land rover. Themba occupied a small swing-out seat at the
      rear, placing him above the others and giving him a good view of the
      country. "now, we go into the jungle, " ken said. "if there's any game to
      spot, themba will find it. " another ten minutes of driving brought them
      off the main road to a grit road and the drive became bumpy. "it gets
      worse as it goes on, " ken said cheerfully, "but you'll get used to it. "
      it did get worse, and ken had to cut down speed. Pot holes began to appear
      in the road and the land rover banged and bumped, making everyone hold on,
      with fennel cursing under his breath. A mile or so further on, themba said
      something to ken, and ken slowed and steered the land rover off the road
      into the bush. They were moving slowly now and they all had to look out
      for thorny bushes and low hanging branches which became hazardous as they
      went on. Suddenly before them was a big waterbuck with its majestic
      antlers, looking towards them. It turned and was away with high leaping
      steps, displaying a perfect ring of white fur around its rump. "oh, i love
      him! " gaye explained. "and that white ring . . . It's marvellous! " "do
      you know how he got that? " ken asked, grinning. "i'll tell you. When
      the"do you know how he got that? " ken asked, grinning. "i'll tell you.
      When the waterbuck arrived at the ark, he rushed up to noah and said, "mr.
      Noah, please where is the nearest toilet? " noah said, "you'll have to
      wait. All the toilets have just been painted. " the waterbuck said, "i
      can't wait. " it's had that ring ever since. " "why don't you look where
      you're driving and stop the yak? " fennel growled while the others
      laughed. "can't please everyone all the time, " ken said, shrugging, and
      continued on. Gaye was noticing that many of the trees were broken and
      dead, giving the bush a stricken look. "did lightning do all this damage?
      " she asked. "what, those trees no . . . Elephants. Must have had a big
      herd through here at one time. The elephant is the most destructive beast
      of any wild game. They strip the trees and smash them as they move.
      Wherever an elephant has been, you'll find dead trees. " a little later
      they came upon five giraffes and ken stopped within fifty metres of them.
      The animals stood motionless, staring. "i wish i hadn't packed my camera,
      " gaye sighed. "they seem completely tame. " "they're not tame . . .
      They're eaten up with curiosity, " ken explained, and even as he spoke the
      gigantic animals turned and lolloped away, covering the ground at high
      speed although seeming to move like a slow motion film. "lions dig for
      them, but they seldom catch them, " ken went on, setting the land rover
      moving again. "are there any lions in this district? " gaye asked. "i'd
      love to see one. " "you will, and hear them too. " themba from his perch
      above them was continually calling to ken, giving him directions.
      Directions. "without this guy, " ken confided to gaye, "i'd never find the
      camp. He has a compass built inside his head. " after half an hour's
      drive, during which time they disturbed a large herd of zebras which went
      crashing away into the thick bush almost before they could be seen, they
      came out of the bush on to a wide flat clearing where the helicopter was
      parked. Squatting before the helicopter were four bantus who rose to their
      feet with wide grins as the land rover pulled up. "here we are, " ken said
      getting out of the truck. "i'll pay these guys off. We don't want them
      hanging around. Themba and i can get the tent up. " garry went at once to
      the helicopter. Gaye slid to the ground and stretched. It had been a bumpy
      ride and she felt stiff and hot. Fennel got down and lit a cigarette. He
      showed no inclination to help themba unload the equipment, but stood with
      his hands in his shorts pockets, eyeing gaye as she stood with her back to
      him, her legs wide apart, her hands on her hips. Ken got rid of the bantus
      and came back to the land rover. "there's a big pool beyond those trees
      and a waterfall, " he said to gaye, pointing. "it's safe swimming . . . No
      crocs. " "can i help? " "no, thanks . . . Themba and i can handle it. " he
      joined themba, and together the two men unloaded the tent. Breathing
      unsteadily, fennel moved over to gaye. "a waterfall, huh? Suppose we go
      take a look at it? " he was expecting her to refuse, and already his
      vicious temper began to rise. She regarded him, her face expressionless,
      then to his surprise, she said, "yes . . . Let's look at it, " and
      turning, she walked ahead, making for the thick line of trees and high
      elephant grass that surrounded the clearing. Fennel felt a hot rush of
      blood through his body. Was this an invitation? Hefennel felt a hot rush
      of blood through his body. Was this an invitation? He looked quickly
      towards the helicopter. Garry was busy stripping off the engine tarpaulin.
      Ken and themba were occupied with unfolding the tent. Shaking a little,
      fennel strode after gaye who had now disappeared into the bush. He caught
      up with her as she moved along a narrow track and he slowed his pace, his
      eyes on her slim back and long beautiful legs. Some twenty metres further
      on they came to a small waterfall that fell some ten metres into a big
      basin of water which flowed at its far end into a broad stream. The basin
      formed a perfect, artificial bathing pool. She turned as he reached her.
      "isn't it lovely? " the sun beat down on them. They were surrounded by
      trees. They could have been the only two people on earth. "let's have a
      swim, " fennel said and stripped off his shirt. "come on, baby, strip off.
      " she looked at his hairy, muscular torso, her eyes watchful as she shook
      her head. "i swim in private, mr. Fennel. " "aw, come on! You don't
      imagine i've never seen a naked woman before, and i bet you've seen a
      naked man. " he grinned fixedly, his face flushed with desire for her.
      "you don't have to be coy with me. Strip off, or i'll have to help you. "
      her cool, unafraid gaze disconcerted him. "you swim . . . I'm going back.
      " as she turned away, he caught hold of her wrist. "you're staying here, "
      he said, his voice low, and unsteady, "and you're stripping off. You want
      some loving, baby, and i'm the guy to give it to you. " "take your hand
      off me, " she said quietly. "come on, baby, don't act coy . . . A little
      loving and then a swim. " she moved towards him, and for a brief moment,
      he thought she was going toshe moved towards him, and for a brief moment,
      he thought she was going to submit to him. Grinning he released his grip
      to encircle her waist. Her hand gripped his wrist and an excruciating pain
      shot up his arm, forcing him to cry out. Her foot slapped against his
      chest as she fell flat on her back. Fennel felt himself shooting into the
      air and then he splashed into the pool. The cool water closed over him,
      and when he bobbed to the surface and had dashed the water out of his
      eyes, he found her standing on the bank, looking down at him. Choking with
      rage, his arm aching, he glared murderously at her, seeing she was holding
      a large chunk of rock in her hands. "stay where you are unless you want
      your skull cracked, " she said. Her stillness and her cold eyes warned him
      she wasn't bluffing. "you bitch! " he snarled. "i'll fix you for this! "
      "you don't frighten me, you fat animal, " she said scornfully. "from now
      on, you leave me alone. If you ever try to touch me again, i'll break your
      arm. If you weren't so important to this operation, i would have done it
      just now. Remember that! Now have a swim and cool off, you revolting ape.
      " she tossed the rock into the water just in front of him, and by the time
      he had cleared his eyes, she had gone. Kahlenberg was signing a batch of
      letters when his office door opened silently and kemosa came in. He waited
      patiently in the doorway until kahlenberg had finished and when kahlenberg
      looked up inquiringly he shuffled forward. He put a small glass bottle on
      the blotter. "there it is, master. " kahlenberg regarded the bottle. "what
      is it? " "the poison you ordered, master. " "i know that . . . What is the
      poison? "kemosa looked blank. "that i don't know, master. " kahlenberg
      made an impatient movement. "did you tell the witch doctor exactly what i
      wanted? " "yes, master. " "a poison that would kill a man in twelve hours?
      " "yes, master. " "is he to be trusted? " "yes, master. " "what did you
      pay him? " "twenty goats. " "did you tell him if the poison doesn't work,
      he will lose all his goats and i will burn his but and turn him off my
      estate? " "i told him that if the poison doesn't work, two men would come
      in the night and throw him in the crocodile pool. " "does he believe that?
      " "yes, master. " kahlenberg nodded, satisfied. "go to the medical chest,
      kemosa, and bring me a syringe and a pair of rubber gloves. "when kemosa
      had left, kahlenberg sat back, looking at the small bottle. His mind went
      back four hundred years. Caesar borgia might also have contemplated a
      similar phial of poison, planning the end of an enemy, feeling the same
      pleasure that kahlenberg was experiencing. He was still sitting motionless
      when kemosa returned with the syringe and gloves. "thank you, " and
      kahlenberg waved him away. When the door had closed, he opened a drawer
      and took out the glass box containing the ring. He took out the ring and
      put it on the fourth finger of his right hand. He studied the flashing
      diamonds thoughtfully, then he turned the ring so the diamonds were worn
      inside. The plain silver band now showing looked very innocent. He took
      off the ring and laid it on the blotter. Then he put on the surgical
      gloves. Screwing the watchmaker's glass into his eye, he slid open the
      trap in the ring. Then laying the ring down again, he uncorked the bottle
      and drew some of the colourless liquid into the syringe. Very carefully he
      inserted the needle of the syringe into the reservoir of the ring and
      equally carefully pressed the plunger. When, through the watchmaker's
      glass, he saw the liquid was level with the top of the reservoir, he
      withdrew the needle and slid the diamond trap into place. Laying down the
      syringe, he wiped the ring on his handkerchief, taking time over the
      operation. Still without removing his gloves, he began shaking the ring
      sharply over the blotter, looking for any signs of a leak in the
      reservoir. Finally satisfied, he put the ring in a drawer, put his
      handkerchief in an envelope and sent for kemosa again. When the old man
      came in, he told him to destroy the syringe, the poison, the gloves and
      the handkerchief. "make certain they are all destroyed, " he said. "you
      understand? Be very careful not to touch the needle of the syringe. "
      "yes, master. " when he had gone, kahlenberg took out the ring and
      regarded it. Was this now a lethal weapon? He asked himself. The witch
      doctor must be over eighty years of age. Had he lost his cunning? Could he
      be trusted? If the poison were lethal, could the tiny hollow needle,
      hidden in the cluster of diamonds, have become blocked with dust? If it
      had he would be wasting his time, and this was something kahlenberg never
      tolerated. He had to know for certain. He sat thinking, then making up his
      mind, he put the ring on the fourth finger of histhinking, then making up
      his mind, he put the ring on the fourth finger of his right hand and
      turned the ring the wrong way round. He propelled himself into the garden,
      followed by hindenburg. It took him a little time to find zwide, a bantu
      about whom kemosa had often complained, saying this man was not only
      incurably lazy but also ill-treated his wife. He was due to be dismissed
      at the end of the month, and to kahlenberg's callous thinking no loss to
      anyone. He found him squatting in the shade, half asleep. When he saw
      kahlenberg, he rose hurriedly to his feet, grabbed up a hoe and began
      feverishly weeding a nearby rose bed. Kahlenberg stopped his chair beside
      him. Hindenburg sat, his eyes watchful. "i hear you are leaving at the end
      of the month, zwide, " kahlenberg said quietly. The man nodded dumbly,
      stiff with fear. Kahlenberg stretched out the ringed hand. "i wish you
      good fortune. Shake my hand. " zwide hesitated, his eyes rolling with
      embarrassment, then reluctantly stretched out his hand. Kahlenberg caught
      the dirty pink palmed hand in a hard, firm grip, his eyes intent on the
      man's face. He saw him give a little start. Then kahlenberg released the
      hand and set the chair in motion. When he had gone a few metres, he looked
      back. Zwide was staring with a bewildered expression at his hand and as
      kahlenberg watched, zwide raised a finger to his mouth and licked it.
      Kahlenberg went on his way. At least the needle had scratched, he thought.
      In twelve hours time he would know if the ring was lethal. As gaye reached
      the clearing, she heard the engine of the helicopter start up. She came to
      a standstill watching the propellers churning. She could see garry at the
      controls. She cried, "hey! Wait for me! " but he didn't hear her. The
      machine took off, climbing steeply and then went out of sight behind the
      trees. Ken and themba had got the tent up. They had been also watching the
      take-off. Now they continued to unload the land rover. She joined them.
      "why didn't he wait for me? " she asked. "that was mean! " ken grinned.
      "you ask him when he comes back. Where's our lovely boy friend? " "having
      a swim. " there was a note in her voice that made him look sharply at her.
      "trouble? " "the usual, but i settled it. " "you're quite a girl. " his
      look of admiration pleased her. "be careful of him . . . He's vicious. "
      "themba and i can take care of him. " he dragged out the four sleeping
      bags. "i'm putting yours between garry's and mine. Themba sleeps next to
      me . . . Then fennel. " she nodded. "it's only for one night, isn't it? "
      "yes . . . For him and me, but two nights for garry and you. " he looked
      up at the clouds moving across the sky. "the sooner we get off the better.
      If it rains the road will be a real mess. You'll be all right on your own
      with garry . . . He's a good guy. " "i know. " he took the sleeping bags
      into the tent and laid them out. Themba was building a fire some little
      way from the tent. Ken collected the .22 rifle and pocketed some
      ammunition. "i'm going after guinea-fowl. Want to come? " "of course. "
      they set off together into the bush. They set off together into the bush.
      Fennel came out of the trees, moving slowly. His arm still ached. He
      looked around, then seeing only themba busy with the fire, he went to the
      land rover, got out his rucksack and went into the tent. He changed out of
      his wet shorts and put on a dry pair. He came out into the dying sunshine
      and sat on one of the wooden cases. His mind was smouldering. Well, he
      would fix her, he told himself as he lit a cigarette. There was time. Get
      the operation over. On the way back, he'd teach her. He was still sitting
      there, brooding, when the helicopter came in to land. After a while garry
      came over. "a beauty, " he said enthusiastically. "goes like a bird. "
      fennel looked up and grunted. "where are the others? " fennel shrugged. "i
      wouldn't know. " "how about a beer? " "yeah. " garry opened the carton.
      Themba came over with glasses and a thermos of ice. As garry was opening
      the bottles, gaye and ken cane out of the bush. Ken had four guinea-fowl
      hanging from a string to his belt. "why didn't you wait for me? " gaye
      demanded. Garry shook his head. "trial flight. First time i've handled
      her. Cockeyed for both of us to get killed. " gaye's eyes opened wide. She
      took the beer themba offered her with a smile. Ken drank from the bottle,
      sighed, then handed the birds to themba who took them away. We'll eat well
      tonight, " ken said and squatted down on the grass. "let's talk business,
      lew. We two and themba leave at first light . . . Around 04.00 hrs.
      Business, lew. We two and themba leave at first light . . . Around 04.00
      hrs. We'll take the rifle and the shotgun, our sleeping bags, rucksacks
      and food. " he looked over at garry, "you any good with a .22? " garry
      grimaced. "never tried. " "i am, " gaye said. "i'll get you a guinea-fowl,
      garry. " "that's fine. " fennel glanced up, looked at gaye, then at garry,
      then looked away. "okay . . . Anyway, you have only one more day here. The
      day after tomorrow you take off for kahlenberg's place. " ken took a
      pencil from his pocket and drew a rough circle in the sand. "i've been
      talking to themba. He's been up to kahlenberg's estate for the past two
      days. " he glanced over at lew who was lighting a cigarette. "you
      listening, lew? " "you think i'm goddamn deaf? " "this circle represents
      kahlenberg's estate. Themba tells me it is guarded by a lot of zulus
      south, west and east, but not on the north side. The road into the estate
      on the north side is reckoned impassable, but themba has been over it. He
      says there's one really tricky bit, but if we can't get over it, we can
      walk. It's our only safe way in. " "how far do we walk if we can't drive?
      " fennel asked, leaning forward as ken marked a spot on the north side of
      the circle. "twenty kilometres as near as damn it. " fennel thought of his
      heavy tool bag. "but there's a chance we can get through in the truck? "
      "themba thinks so, so long as it doesn't rain too hard. If it really rains
      then we are in trouble. ""well; some people have all the luck, " fennel
      said, looking over at garry, but garry wasn't to be drawn. He got up and
      walked over to watch themba cooking the birds. He wished he could speak
      afrikaans. There was something about the big bantu's face that appealed to
      him. As if reading his thoughts, themba looked up and grinned cheerfully
      and then continued to turn the spit. Gaye joined garry. "hmmmm, smells
      good . . . I'm starving. " themba raised a finger and crossed it with, a
      finger of his left hand. "that means you have to wait half an hour, "
      garry said. "come over to the chopper. I'll tell you about it. " they
      walked over to the helicopter. Fennel watched them, his eyes glittering.
      Ken had no desire to talk to him. He went over and joined themba. They
      spoke together in afrikaans. "looks like rain soon? " ken said, squatting
      beside the bantu. "could come tonight. " ken grimaced. "well, we've got
      the winch. If that doesn't pull us out, nothing will. " "yes. " they
      talked on. Half an hour later, the birds were cooked. It was dark now and
      the air heavy and close. They oil sat around the fire, eating with their
      fingers. Without fennel, he party could have been gay, but his dour
      expression and his silence killed any light-hearted atmosphere. When they
      had finished and themba had cleared up, ken said, "i'm turning in. We have
      to be up early tomorrow. " "yes . . . I'm dying to sleep. " gaye got to
      her feet. "give you five minutes to get into your bag, " ken said, then
      i'm coming in. " gaye disappeared into the tent. "i guess i'll join you, "
      garry said, stretching. "that was some meal. " he looked at fennel. "you
      turning in? " "is the smoke sleeping in there? " "if you mean is themba
      sleeping in there . . . He is. " fennel spat in the fire. "i don't dig
      breathing the same air as a black man. " "okay . . . Take your sleeping
      bag out then. " fennel got swiftly to his feet and advanced on ken, his
      fists clenched. He was much more powerfully built than ken who wouldn't
      have stood a chance against him. Garry stepped between them, facing
      fennel. "i'm getting fed up with you, " he said evenly. "if you're aching
      to hit some one, hit me. " fennel eyed him, hesitated, then backed away.
      "go to hell, " he growled and sat down. He sat by the dying fire long
      after the others were sleeping, then finally realizing he must get some
      sleep, he entered the tent and crawled into his sleeping bag. Towards
      02.00 hrs. The sound of rain drumming on the roof of the tent woke them
      all. Above the sound of the rain came the choked roar of a lion. Chapter
      six fennel came awake as someone turned on a powerful flashlight. He could
      see ken wriggling out of his sleeping bag. Themba held the flashlight and
      was leaving the tent. "time to go? " fennel asked with a yawn. "just
      about. Themba's getting the breakfast. I'm going down for a swim . . .
      Coming? " fennel grunted, slipped on his shoes and shorts and grabbed up a
      towel. He followed ken out into the damp half light. It had stopped
      raining, but the clouds were heavy and swollen. "going to be sticky, " ken
      said as the two men trotted down to the pool, "but with the winch, and if
      we're lucky, we'll make it. " reaching the pool, they dived in, swam
      across, turned and swam back and came out. They towelled themselves
      vigorously, slipped into their shorts, then trotted back to the camp. Both
      gaye and garry were up and squatting by the fire watching themba frying a
      batch of eggs and bacon. By the time they had finished breakfast and
      themba had cleared up, it was light enough to move. "well, let's go, " ken
      said. Turning to garry, he went on, "do you think you can get the tent
      down and fold it? " "sure. I'll pack it in the chopper . . . Right? " "if
      you leave it here, it'll disappear for sure. " ken looked a themba. "all
      okay? " themba nodded. "let's synchronize our watches. We'll call you on
      radio at 11.00 hrs. Just to report progress. After that we'll call you
      every two hours . . . Okay? " they checked their watches, then garry
      offered his hand. "good luck . . . Watch that bastard. " fennel was
      putting his tool kit in the land rover. He got in at the back and sat on
      the bench seat, staring moodily ahead. "sweet type, isn't he? " ken
      grinned. He turned to gaye and shook hands. They watched him slide into
      the driving seat. Themba waved a cheerful hand and got in the front seat
      beside ken. Ken drove into the jungle where it was dark enough for him to
      put on the headlights. He drove slowly, and fennel wondered how the hell
      anyone could know where he was going in this dense jungle. Themba was
      continually directing ken. Maybe this blackie wasn't all that of a monkey,
      fennel thought. He knew he himself would be helpless on his own, and this
      thought riled him. As they progressed, the sun began to come up and ken
      switched off the headlights. He was able to increase speed' slightly. It
      was a nagging, bumpy ride and fennel had to hang on. Themba suddenly
      pointed and ken slowed. "to your right . . . A rhino! " fennel swivelled
      his head. Standing not more than twenty metres away was a huge rhinoceros.
      The ungainly animal slowly turned its head to stare at them. Fennel eyed
      the big horn and he reached for the springfield, aware his heart was
      beginning to thump. "they're dangerous, aren't they? " he asked, his voice
      low. "that's the white rhino. He's docile, " ken told him. "it's the black
      one you have to watch out for. " he drove on, increasing speed. At this
      hour the bush seemed alive with game. Herds of impala scattered at the
      approach of the land rover. Two warthogswent crashing into the shrubs,
      their tails up like periscopes. Black bellied storks watched them from the
      tree tops. It was as they were nearing the edge of the bush that themba
      pointed, and ken said, "lions! " lying by the side of the track were two
      full grown male lions. Fennel calculated they would pass within four
      metres of them. "you're not passing those bastards? " he demanded.
      "nothing to worry about, " ken said cheerfully. "you leave a lion alone
      and he'll leave you alone. " but fennel wasn't convinced. He picked up the
      springfield, his finger curling around the trigger. They were nearly on
      the lions now. Both beasts raised their heads and regarded the on-coming
      land rover with sleepy indifference. Fennel felt sweat on his face. As
      they passed, they were so close he could have touched the lions with the
      end of the rifle. "see? " ken said. "you don't have to worry about lions,
      but you wound one and go in after him and you'll have a hell of a lot to
      worry about. " fennel put down the rifle and wiped his sweating face with
      the back of his hand. "that was too damn close. " they came out of the
      jungle on to a dirt road. Themba indicated that ken should turn to the
      right. "this is the road leading to kahlenberg's estate . . . The whole
      sixty kilometres of it, " ken said after he had talked with themba. He
      looked at his watch. The time was 08.00 hrs. "themba reckons we'll get to
      the edge of the estate in three hours. We'll radio back to garry when we
      get there. " "three hours to do sixty kilometres. You nuts? " "the road's
      bad. It could take us longer. " the road was bad, and gradually
      deteriorated. It was climbing gently all thethe road was bad, and
      gradually deteriorated. It was climbing gently all the time. The night's
      rain had softened the surface and the land rover began to slide a little.
      Ahead of them was a very sharp rise and as ken increased speed for the run
      up, the back wheels slid and ken hurriedly steered into the skid just as
      it seemed they were about to leave the road. "watch what you're doing! "
      fennel snarled, startled. "i can do without a back seat driver, " ken
      returned. "just shut up, will you? " the land rover crawled up the rise
      and ken slammed on his brakes when he saw the dip below was full of water
      and there was another sharp rise to get out of the dip. "we're not going
      through that, " he said and put the truck into reverse, slowly sliding
      back down the rise. He then drove off the road and on to the tangle of
      dead branches, shrubs and coarse, rain soaked grass. They hadn't gone more
      than ten metres when the rear wheels spun and fennel felt the truck sink.
      Ken gave the engine more gas, resulting only in producing a shower of wet,
      sticky mud that sprinkled them as the wheels spun. Themba sprang out and
      went around to the back. Ken engaged gear while themba pushed, but they
      only sank deeper. Ken turned, and as he disengaged gear, he looked
      straight at fennel. "let's get this straight, lew. Are you with us or are
      you just a goddamn passenger? " fennel hesitated, then got down from the
      land rover. His bull strength combined with themba's weight began to tell.
      There was more splattering of mud, then the tyres got a new purchase and
      the land rover came out of the two holes it had dug. Walking beside it,
      ready to go into action again, fennel and themba, watched warily. Twice
      the land rover skidded but righted itself. They were past the dip now and
      ken steered back on the road. "see what i mean? " he said. "twenty minutes
      wasted. " fennel grunted and climbed on board. He was breathing heavily.
      By now the sun was hot and beat down on them. Ken increased speed and they
      continued toclimb, banging and bumping over the stony road, avoiding the
      water filled pot- holes where he could, and when he couldn't, banging into
      them, jolting them all and making fennel curse. The road narrowed suddenly
      and became nothing better than a rough track, strewn with fair-sized
      boulders. Three times during the next hundred metres, themba had to jump
      down and heave the rocks out of the way. They were now crawling at around
      ten kilometres an hour. It didn't look to fennel as if any vehicle had
      ever come along this narrow track which kept climbing. Branches of trees
      hung low, causing both men to keep ducking. Themba was walking ahead now
      as the land rover's speed was even more reduced. "you mean we've got
      another fifty kilometres of this bitching road to drive on? Fennel
      exclaimed as he ducked under another branch. "that's about it. According
      to themba it gets worse as we go on, but at least we are moving. " that
      appeared to be a rash thing to have said for almost immediately they
      struck a soft patch of ground and before ken could control the skid, they
      had slid off the narrow track and the offside wheels slammed down into a
      gutter. They stopped. "themba came running back as ken got out of the land
      rover. The two men surveyed the position of the wheels and discussed it
      together while fennel got down and lit a cigarette. He felt irritatingly
      useless. To him, they looked stuck for good. "only thing to do is to lift
      her out, " ken said. He began to unload the truck, handing the jerrycans
      of water and gas to themba. Fennel got the rucksacks, sleeping bags and
      his heavy tool bag out. "back wheels first, " ken said. The three men got
      grips and at ken's shout, heaved up. Their combined strength lifted the
      wheels and the next heave got the tail of the truck back on to the road.
      "i can pull her out now, " ken said. "you two shove against the side in
      case she slides in again. "three minutes later, the land rover was once
      more on the road. They hastily reloaded, then fennel said, "i'm having a
      drink. " ken nodded and themba opened two bottles of beer and a bottle of
      tonic water for himself. Fennel looked at themba. "you say it's going to
      get worse? " "so he says, " ken broke in. "no use talking to him, he
      doesn't understand english. " fennel emptied his bottle of beer. "looks
      like we three have picked the crappy end of the stick, doesn't it? " he
      said. "that's the way the cookie crumbles. " ken finished his beer, tossed
      the bottle into the gutter and climbed under the driving wheel. "let's go.
      " at least the two incidents seemed to have made fennel more human, he
      thought as he engaged gear. He had spoken to themba and he had shown a
      spark of comradeship. They now came to a series of steep hairpin bends.
      Using the four wheel drive, ken continued the climb but at not much more
      than twelve kilometres an hour. The exertion of dragging the wheel around
      as he came into the bends and then straightening was making him sweat. The
      bends seemed to go on and on and they climbed higher and higher. Fennel
      leaned forward. "want me to take a turn? I can handle this crate. " ken
      shook his head. Ken shook his head. "thanks . . . I can cope. " he spoke
      to themba in afrikaans and themba replied. Feeling out of it, fennel
      demanded, "what are you talking about? " "at the top is the bad place.
      Themba says this is where we could get stuck for good. " "that's fine! Bad
      place! What the hell does he call this? " ken laughed. "from what he says,
      this is like driving down piccadilly to what we're coming to. " then from
      nowhere grey sluggish clouds crossed the sun, shutting it out and it
      turned cold. As ken left the last hairpin bend and started up a long
      narrow, rocky rise, the rain came down in solid warm sheets. The three men
      were soaked to the skin in seconds and ken, blinded, stopped the land
      rover. They all crouched forward, shielding their faces with their arms
      while the rain slammed down on their bowed backs. They remained like that
      for some minutes. Water was in the land rover and sloshing around.
      Fennel's shoes, and water lay inches deep on the tarpaulin covering their
      equipment. Abruptly as it began, the rain ceased, the clouds moved away
      and the sun came out. In a very few minutes their clothes began to steam.
      "this is one hell of a picnic, " fennel said. "my goddamn cigarettes are
      soaked! " ken took a pack from the glove compartment and offered it. "take
      these. " "i'll take one . . . Keep the rest in there. If the bitch is
      going to start again, we don't want to run short. " they both lit up and
      then got back into the truck. Themba had walked on ahead. By now he was at
      the top of the rise and stood waiting. As they reached him, he motioned
      ken to stop. Both men looked beyond him at the road ahead. They appeared
      to be on the top of a mountain and the trackthe road ahead. They appeared
      to be on the top of a mountain and the track abruptly narrowed. One side
      was a sloping bank of coarse grass and shrubs; the other side was a sheer
      drop into the valley. Fennel stood up in the land rover and stared at the
      track. He was never sure of himself when in high places, and the sight of
      the distant valley far below and the narrowness of the rough track brought
      him out in a sweat. "we're bitched! " he said, his voice unsteady. "we
      can't hope to get through there! " ken turned and looked sharply at him.
      Seeing his ashen face and how his hands were shaking, he realized this was
      a man with no head for heights and felt sorry for him. "look, lew, you get
      out. I think i can get through. It'll be a tight squeeze, but it can be
      done. " "don't be a fool! You'll kill your goddamn self! " ken shouted to
      themba. "can i do it? " the bantu stood in the middle of the track and
      regarded the land rover, then he nodded. "just, " he said. "what's he say?
      " fennel demanded. "he thinks it's all right. " "all right? Hell! You'll
      go over! " "you get out. " fennel hesitated, then picking up his tool bag,
      he got down on to the track. "wait a minute, " he said, sweat pouring down
      his face, "if you're going to kill yourself, i'm goin to get all the
      equipment off first. If she goes over, we'll be stuck without food or
      drink. " "maybe you have something there, " ken said with a wide grin. He
      climbed over the back and themba realizing what they were doing joined
      them. The three menthe back and themba realizing what they were doing
      joined them. The three men carefully lifted off the tarpaulin, draining
      the rain water on to the track, then they hastily unloaded all the
      equipment. Fennel glanced at his watch. It was 10.55 hrs. "we'll have a
      beer, " he said. "in five minutes you have to contact edwards. How much
      farther have we to go? " ken consulted themba as he opened two beer
      bottles. "about twenty kilometres. Then another ten kilometres to the big
      house, " themba told him. Ken translated. "rough going? " themba said once
      over this bit the going was good. They finished the beer and then ken
      picked up the two-way radio. "ken to garry . . . Are you receiving me? "
      immediately: "garry to ken . . . Loud and clear. How goes it? " briefly
      ken explained the situation. "sounds dicey. Look, ken, why not use the
      winch? Anchor ahead and wind yourself in. If the truck slips you have a
      chance to jump. " "idea. Roger. Call you back. Out. " "i bet he feels
      smug, " fennel growled. "did he say if he's laid that bitch yet? " "skip
      it, lew, " ken said impatiently. He talked to themba who nodded and taking
      the tarpaulin cover off the winch, he ran the cable out until he was
      beyond the narrowest part of the track. Ken gave fennel the drag. "you any
      good at splicing? It's got to be secure. ""you any good at splicing? It's
      got to be secure. " "i'll fix it. " averting his eyes from the drop on his
      right, fennel joined themba, anchor in hand, his tool bag slung over his
      shoulder. It took him a little over half an hour before he was satisfied.
      While he worked, ken sat behind the wheel and smoked. He had steady nerves
      and was quite cool. He knew there was a risk, but he was also confident
      that he could get through. Finally fennel stood up. "it's okay. " he had
      fixed the drag firmly in a root of a massive tree, growing nearby and
      using a club hammer, he hammered the drag well home. He walked back to the
      land rover. "that won't come out. The cable won't burst. Depends now if
      the winch gets torn out of its casing. " "cheer up, " ken said, grinning.
      "well, let's try. Will you stay behind me, lew? If the back begins to
      slide either correct it or yell to me if you can't. I want themba ahead to
      watch the offside wheels. " "i'll tell you something, " fennel said,
      breathing heavily. "you've got more bloody guts than i have. " the two men
      looked at each other, then ken turned, set the engine going, released the
      handbrake and moved the lever operating the winch forward. The drum began
      to revolve. He quickly cut the speed of the drum and the land rover began
      to inch forward. Fennel walked behind, both his hands on the tailboard of
      the truck, his eyes on themba who was squatting down, his eyes glued to
      the front wheels, beckoning ken on. The truck covered ten metres before
      themba raised his hand sharply to stop. Ken flicked the winch lever to
      neutral. "what's the matter now? " fennel growled from behind. Themba had
      gone to the"what's the matter now? " fennel growled from behind. Themba
      had gone to the drag and was looking at it. "does that black ape think i
      would let it pull loose? " fennel snarled. "that's in, and it'll stay in!
      " "don't get so worked up, " ken said, taking out a soiled handkerchief
      and wiping his face. Satisfied, themba went back to the middle of the
      track. "four more metres and you're on the narrow bit, " he called. Ken
      set the drum revolving again. The land rover began to crawl forward again.
      Then the unpredictable happened, three metres before the narrows. The
      road, sodden by the rain, crumbled under the weight of the truck. Fennel
      felt the back sliding towards the drop and he threw his weight desperately
      against the tailboard, trying to steer the truck back, yelling to ken to
      jump. He felt himself being dragged to the edge, and shuddering, he let go
      and rolled on his back towards the grass slope. He was on his feet in an
      instant, but the land rover had gone. He looked wildly up the road.
      Themba, on the edge of the drop, was staring down, his big eyes rolling.
      Cursing, fennel saw the taut cable was vibrating, and steeling himself, he
      went to the edge, feeling sick and dizzy, and looked over. Four metres
      below, dangling by the cable was the land rover. Ken was standing on the
      back of the seat, his hands gripping the wind shield. Far, far below
      spread out like an aerial map, was the valley. Even as he looked, fennel
      saw the drum was slowly parting from the casing. "get to the drum! " he
      bawled. "ken . . . It's coming away! Get the drum! " ken balanced himself,
      stepped over the wind shield and flattened himself up right on the
      perpendicular bonnet. He caught hold of one of the steel stanchions
      supporting the drum, heaved forward, his hands around the cable of the
      drum. Even as he got a grip, the drum parted from the truck and the truck
      went hurtling down into the void. Ken swung on the end of the cable.
      Themba had the cable in his hands and was trying to haul him in. Shaking
      from head to foot, fennel joined him. Ken swung hard against the side of
      the mountain and his feet got a purchase. As the two men hauled, he began
      to walk up the slightly sloping side and moments later, hehauled, he began
      to walk up the slightly sloping side and moments later, he rolled on to
      the track. He sat up and forced a grin. "now, we will damn well have to
      walk, " he said. As the land rover drove into the bush, gaye sighed with
      relief. "well, thank goodness, he's out of the way, " she said. "he was
      really beginning to get on my nerves. " "mine too. " garry lit a
      cigarette. "do you want some more coffee? " she shook her head. "when it
      gets lighter, i'll have a swim. The pool looks marvellous. " she wandered
      over to the fire and knelt before it. Garry watched her, thinking how
      lovely she looked, the flames of the fire lighting up her face. Then he
      went into the tent, found his cordless electric razor and shaved in the
      light of the flash-lamp. As he shaved, he thought of the hours ahead of
      them before they took off. He was sharply aware that they were alone
      together. Firmly, he put the thought out of his mind. Picking up the
      towel, he left the tent. The light was brighter now. In another hour the
      sun would be up, but he felt in need of cold water and was too impatient
      to wait. "i'll take my swim first, " he called to her. "are you all right
      alone here? " "yes, unless a lion turns up. It'll be cold. " "that's how i
      like it. " she watched him move off into the shadows and she fed the fire
      with more sticks collected in a big heap by themba. She also thought of
      the hours ahead. She admitted to herself that fennel in his brutish way
      had stirred a dormant desire in her for a man. How long, she pondered, had
      it been since she had had a satisfactory lover? Her mind went back over
      the number of men who had shared her bed. She could remember only two who
      had really pleased and satisfied her. The first had been a little like
      garry, not so tall and more handsome . . . An american on vacation. She
      had been in paris, modelling clothes. On one hot july night, she had been
      sitting alone at fouquet's cafe which had been crowded. He had come up and
      asked if he could share her table. They had looked at eachhad come up and
      asked if he could share her table. They had looked at each other, and she
      knew immediately that she would be sleeping with him within a few hours as
      he too seemed to know. Again, the second man, also an american and also
      who had looked a little like garry, had come out of the dimness of a bar
      where she had been waiting for friends and had invited her to drink with
      him. They had left the bar together before her friends arrived. She
      decided this garry type of man had sexual attraction for her that sparked
      with her instantly as two flints struck together will cause a spark. She
      had only met these two men once and only knew their christian names, but
      the few hours she had spent with them were etched on her mind, and now
      after that ape fennel had aroused her after so long, she knew that
      sometime during the day, garry would become her lover. The sun was rising,
      and already she could feel its warmth. She moved away from the fire and
      went into the tent to straighten up. By the time she had finished, she
      could feel the heat of the sun coming through the canvas of the tent and
      she went out, taking a towel with her. She saw garry coming towards her,
      wearing shorts and shoes, his towel over his shoulder. She smiled at him.
      "was it good? " "marvellous, but cold. It'll be fine now. " "see you
      later. " she was aware that he was looking at her as the two americans had
      looked at her, then he looked away. She nodded and ran off, swinging her
      towel, towards the pool. She seldom had the opportunity of swimming naked
      and this she loved to do. She stripped off and dived in. The sun was fully
      on the pool by now and the chill was off the water. She swam for some
      time, then turned on her back, closed her eyes and let herself float. Two
      grey, black-faced monkeys high up in a tree watched her. Then as if by
      agreement, they slid down the tree, moved swiftly to where she had left
      her shorts, shirt and towel, snatched them up and shinned up the tree
      again. Having examined the clothes and finding them of no interest, they
      left them hanging on a high branch and went swinging from tree to tree
      farther into the forest. As they went, gaye opened her eyes and saw them.
      She watched them, thinking how cute they looked, but she didn't think them
      cute when, on climbing out of the pool, she found only her shoes on the
      bank. Looking up, she caught sight of her towel hanging on a branch. She
      hesitated, knowing she could never climb up there, then shrugging, she put
      on her shoes and walked back to the camp. Garry, sitting in the shade of
      the tent, was examining the aerial map shalik had given him. He glanced up
      as she came out of the line of trees and startled, he dropped the map. For
      a moment, he couldn't believe his eyes, then he got to his feet. Quite
      unconcerned, naked as she was born, gaye came on. "monkeys have stolen my
      clothes . . . The little devils. They are up a tree by the pool. Could you
      get them for me, garry? " she called as she was half-way across the plain.
      She made no attempt to hide her nakedness. Her arms swung loosely at her
      sides as she moved. She behaved as if she were fully dressed. "sure. . . "
      he started towards her, then deliberately made a wide half circle so he
      wouldn't pass close to her and she liked him for that. They passed and she
      went into the tent. She was quite sure he hadn't looked back at her. Her
      heart was beating fast. She went to her rucksack to get her duplicate
      shirt and shorts. She got them out, looked at them, hesitated, then
      dropped them to the ground and stretched herself out on top of her
      sleeping bag. With her legs crossed and her hands covering her breasts,
      she waited his return. "it's nearly 11.00 hrs. , " garry said. "they will
      be coming through on the radio. " she was loath to let him go, but as he
      moved away from her, she let her arms slide away from his body. She
      watched him stand up and put on his shorts, then she closed her eyes. She
      had been right about him. It had been even better than it had been with
      the other two americans, and also, she did know his surname. The tensions
      that had been building up inside her for the past year had been released
      by the explosive coupling, and now she felt as if she had had a shot of
      some hard drug. She didn't wish to be disturbed, but to be allowed to
      remain still and to do nothing. She drifted off int0 semi-sleep which was
      all the more relaxing and pleasant in the heat of the tent. She was
      startled awake by garry coming to the opening of the tent and calling her
      name sharply. She half sat up and immediately became fully alert at the
      sight of his worried expression. "what is it? " "those three are in
      trouble. Put your things on and come out. It's too damn hot in here. "
      there was a hard note in his voice and she could see he was impatient with
      her lying there like a cat before a fire. She slipped into her clothes and
      came out to join him in the shade. The road collapsed, and they've lost
      the land rover, " garry told her. "ken was nearly killed. " "is he hurt? "
      "no . . . Shaken, but all right, now they'll have to walk and it's a hell
      of a walk. " "but they'll get there? " "they think so. They'll be
      contacting me again in two hours. " "and the equipment? ""that's all
      right. They unloaded before attempting to get over the worst part of the
      track. " "how will they get back? " "we'll all have to fly out . . .
      Nothing else for it. It'll be a load, but it can be done. " she relaxed,
      resting her back against the tree. "so it really isn't so bad . . .
      They'll just have to walk. " "in this heat, it won't be so good. " "oh,
      well . . . Get some of that ape's fat off. Do you know how to pluck and
      draw a bird, garry? " "no . . . Do you? " "no. So we won't bother to hunt
      guinea-fowl. We'll have beans and bacon for lunch. " she got to her feet.
      "i'm going to have another swim . . . Coming? " he hesitated. "those three
      are worrying me, gaye. " "then a swim with me will put them out of your
      mind. There's nothing we can do for them . . . So come on and swim. " she
      went into the tent for the towels and then together they walked in the
      burning sun towards the pool. Fennel wished now he hadn't drunk so much
      beer in the past. The rough, stony track, the hot sun and the pace that
      ken was setting all reminded him of how out of condition he was. The strap
      of his tool bag was rubbing his shoulder raw. Sweat streamed down his face
      and blackened his shirt. He was breathing heavily. At a guess, he thought,
      they had covered only six kilometres. Ken had talked of thirty kilometres
      before they reached kahlenberg's place. Twenty-four kilometres! Fennel
      gritted his teeth. He was certain he couldn't do it with this tool kit: it
      got heavier and heavier with every step he took. Apart from his tool kit,
      he was also carrying his rucksack. Before setting off, they had decided to
      leave the sleeping bags and the shotgun. Ken carried the springfield and
      his own rucksack, themba was carrying aken carried the springfield and his
      own rucksack, themba was carrying a rucksack stuffed with provisions and a
      five litre jerrycan of water. Fennel plodded on, dragging one foot after
      the other. He longed for some shade, but there was none on this narrow
      track. He badly wanted a drink and thought regretfully of the beer they
      had left behind them. He had wanted it along with them, but when ken said
      it was okay with him if fennel would carry it, fennel decided against the
      idea. He paused to wipe the sweat out of his eyes and was stung with
      mortification to see the other two walking and chatting together, well
      ahead of him. Ken glanced back and then stopped. Themba continued on for a
      few steps and then he stopped. Fennel felt a spurt of rage go through him.
      He came plodding up to them. One look at his exhausted face told ken that
      he was going to be a liability. Themba thought so too, and putting down
      the jerrycan he said something to fennel who didn't understand. "he says
      he'll carry your tool bag if you'll carry the jerrycan, " ken translated.
      Fennel hesitated, but he knew the bag now was too much for him. "what
      makes him think he can carry it? " he demanded, lowering the bag
      thankfully to the ground. "he wouldn't make the offer if he didn't, " ken
      pointed out as themba hoisted up the bag and slung it on his shoulder.
      Fennel hesitated, then said, "well, tell him . . . Thanks. It's a bitch of
      a thing to carry. " he caught hold of the jerrycan and the three men
      continued on their way: the other two slowing down to keep pace with
      fennel. The next hour was a hellish up-hill grind for fennel, but he kept
      plodding on, breathing heavily, furious with himself to see how easily the
      other two were taking the ordeal. "how about a drink? " he gasped, coming
      to a halt. "how about a drink? " he gasped, coming to a halt. But the
      drink gave him no satisfaction as the water was warm and anyway, fennel
      loathed drinking water. Ken looked at his watch. "in another ten minutes,
      we'll call garry. Then we'll have a rest. " "that guy must have been born
      lucky, " fennel growled, picking up the jerrycan. "he doesn't know how
      well off he is. " they continued on, and at 13.00 hrs. , they left the
      track and sat down in the shade of the jungle. Ken contacted garry and
      reported progress. "we should be in position by 18.00 hrs. , " he said,
      and added the going was rough. Garry made sympathetic noises, said he
      would be standing by at 15.00 hrs. And switched off. After half an hour's
      rest, they continued on for another hour, then ken said it was time to
      eat. They left the sun soaked track and sat down in the shade of the
      trees. Themba opened cans of steak pie and baked beans. "how much farther?
      " fennel asked, his mouth full. Ken consulted themba. "about six
      kilometres and then we'll be in the jungle. " "ask him if he wants me to
      carry the bag again. " "he's okay . . . Don't bother about it. " "ask him!
      That bag's goddamn heavy! " ken spoke to themba who grinned and shook his
      head. "black people are used to carrying white men's burdens, " ken said,
      keeping his face straight. Fennel eyed him. "okay, i'll take that . . . So
      he's a better man than i am. " "skip it or i'll burst into tears. " fennel
      smiled sourly. "my time's coming. You two may be pretty hot with this
      jungle and walking crap, but you wait until you see me in action. " ken
      offered his pack of cigarettes and the two men lit up. Do you think he's
      giving it to her? " fennel asked abruptly. When not on his discomforts,
      his mind kept returning to gaye. "who's giving what to whom? " ken asked
      blandly. Fennel hesitated, then shrugged. "forget it! " an hour later,
      they again contacted garry and again reported progress, then they left the
      mountain track and entered the jungle. Although it was steamy hot, the
      relief of constant shade helped them to quicken their pace. Themba led the
      way with ken and fennel following. A narrow track through the dense
      undergrowth forced them to walk in single file. Overhead, vervet monkeys
      swung from tree to tree, watching them. A big sable buck that was standing
      in the middle of the track as they rounded a high shrub went crashing away
      into the jungle, startling fennel. They had to keep a watch-out for shrubs
      with long, sharp thorns, and they all concentrated on the ground ahead of
      them. None of them suspected that they were being watched. High on a
      branch of a tree sat a giant zulu, wearing only a leopard skin. In his
      right hand, he held a two-way radio. He waited until the three men had
      passed, then spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece of the radio, his message
      being picked up by miah, kahlenberg's secretary, who had been detailed to
      keep in touch with the twenty watching zulus positioned to report the
      movements of strangers on the estate. From the moment the three men
      entered the jungle, they were never out of sight from the watchful eyes of
      the zulus, hidden in the undergrowth or concealed in the tree tops. Miah
      took down the zulus' reports in rapid shorthand, passed them to ho-du who
      rapidly transcribed them on a typewriter and then had them sent
      immediately to kahlenberg. Kahlenberg was enjoying this. The drama of the
      land rover had been observed and reported to him, and now he knew these
      three men were actually on his estate. He turned to tak. "the bantu is
      expendable, " he said. "give the order that if the occasion presents
      itself, he is to be got rid of. As he seems to be acting as a guide, it is
      unlikely the others will be able to find their way out without him. " tak
      picked up a two-way radio and spoke softly into it. While he was speaking,
      ken called a brief rest as they reached a clearing in the jungle. The
      three men sat down in the shade and all took a drink of water. Ken talked
      to themba for a few minutes. Themba pointed. Ahead of them was a narrow
      track that led into dense undergrowth. "that's the track that leads
      directly to kahlenberg's place, " ken explained to fennel. "we can't miss
      it. We'll leave themba here, and we'll go on. If we come unstuck, i don't
      want him involved. When we have done the job, we'll pick him up here and
      he'll guide us out. Okay? " "you're sure we can find our way without him?
      "we follow the track. It leads directly to the house. " "well, okay. "
      fennel looked at his watch. "how long will it take to get to the house? "
      "about two hours. We'll go now. We'll get near enough to the house before
      dark. " fennel grunted and got to his feet. Ken talked again to themba who
      grinned, nodding his head. Ken talked again to themba who grinned, nodding
      his head. "we'll take some food with us. I've got a water bottle, " ken
      said, turning to fennel. "you'll have to carry your kit again. " "okay,
      okay, i'm not a cripple. " themba put some canned food into ken's
      rucksack. "we'll leave our other stuff here, " ken went on, shouldering
      the rucksack, "and the rifle. " he shook hands with themba. Speaking in
      afrikaans, he said, "we'll be back the day after tomorrow night. If we are
      not back in four days, go home. " fennel came up to themba. He looked
      slightly embarrassed as he pointed to his bag of tools, then grinning
      sheepishly, he offered his hand. Themba was delighted and grinning widely,
      he gripped the offered hand. As he fell into step beside ken, fennel said,
      "i was wrong about him . . . He's a good man. " "we all make mistakes, "
      ken looked at fennel with a sly grin. "i seemed to have been wrong about
      you. " themba watched them walk into the jungle and disappear. He set out
      collecting sticks for the fire he would light at dusk. He liked being on
      his own and was always at home in the jungle. He was slightly curious why
      the two white men had gone off on their own, but decided it was no
      business of his. He was being well paid for acting as a guide, and already
      ken had given him enough money to enable him to buy a small car when he
      returned to durban where he rented a bungalow in which his wife and son
      lived. He didn't see much of them as he was constantly on various game
      reserves in the district, but every other week-end, he would come home . .
      . Something he always looked forward to. He made a neat pile of sticks
      near the tree where the equipment was stacked, then moved into the jungle
      to find a few dead branches to give guts to the fire. Suddenly he paused
      to listen. Something had moved not far from him. His keen ears had
      distinctly heard the rustle of leaves. A baboon? He wondered. He stood
      motionless, looking in the direction of the sound. Out of a thicket behind
      him, rose a zulu, wearing a leopard skin across his broad muscular
      shoulders. The sun glittered; on the broad blade of his assagai. For a
      brief moment, he balanced the heavy stabbing spear in his huge black hand,
      then threw it with unerring aim and with tremendous force at themba's
      unprotected back. High in the evening sky, six vultures began to circle
      patiently. Chapter seven "there it is on your right, " garry said
      suddenly. Gaye peered through the helicopter's window. They were flying
      over dense jungle, and as garry banked, the jungle abruptly terminated and
      she could see acres of rich green lawns, green cement paths and vast beds
      of flowers that would have done credit to a botanical garden. Beyond the
      lawns she saw the one storey house which was built in a slight curve, and
      from this height, seemed to her, to be at least seventy metres long.
      Behind the house, some two hundred metres away were numerous small
      bungalows with thatched roofs and white painted walls in which she
      supposed the staff lived. "it's enormous! " she exclaimed. "what an
      extraordinary shape! Imagine walking from one end to the other several
      times a day. " "perhaps they use skates, " garry said. "it's certainly
      big. " he circled the house again. They could see a swimming-pool,
      terraces, sun umbrellas and lounging chairs. "we'd better get down. Are
      you nervous? " she shook her head, smiling. "not a bit . . . Excited. I
      wonder if we'll get in. " "you've got to get us in, " garry said. He
      spotted the airfield and a hangar. As he came lower, he saw three zulus in
      white drill, staring up at the helicopter. He landed not far from them and
      as he slid back the door, he saw a jeep coming along the road from the
      house, driven by a zulu with a white man in a grey city- suit sitting at
      his side. "here comes the welcoming committee, " he said and dropped to
      the ground. Gaye handed him down the rolleiflex camera and her camera bag,
      and then joined him on the runway as the jeep pulled up. Tak got out of
      the jeep and came towards them. Leaving garry, gaye advanced to meet him.
      Garry, gaye advanced to meet him. "i am gaye desmond of animal world
      magazine, " she said and held out her hand. Tak regarded her, thinking she
      was even more lovely than her photograph. He took her hand briefly and
      gave her a little bow. "i apologize for landing like this, " gaye went on.
      There was something about this tall man that she instantly distrusted and
      disliked. "i'm on my way to wannock game reserve, and i saw this lovely
      house and just couldn't resist calling. If i shouldn't have, please tell
      me, and i will leave at once. " "not at all, miss desmond, " tak said
      silkily. "we seldom have such a beautiful visitor. Now you are here, i
      hope you will stay to lunch. " "how nice of you! We would love to, mr. . .
      . " she looked inquiringly at him. "guilio tak. " she turned to garry who
      joined them. "mr. Tak, this is garry edwards, my pilot. " again tak bowed.
      "mr. Tak has kindly invited us to lunch. " garry shook hands with tak. He
      too didn't like the look of him. Gaye went on, "the house is marvellous
      and so isolated! I couldn't believe my eyes when i saw it. Have you had it
      long, mr. Tak? " "this is not my residence, miss desmond. It belongs to
      mr. Max kahlenberg. " gaye stared at him, her eyes widening. "you mean the
      millionaire? The mr. Max kahlenberg? " the expression in his black eyes
      was slightly sardonic as tak said, "that is correct. "correct. " "but i
      have heard he is a recluse! " gaye said. Watching her, garry thought she
      was putting over the act well. "we'd better go. We mustn't disturb him. "
      "you won't do that. Mr. Kahlenberg is not a recluse. I am sure he will be
      pleased to meet you. " "would it be possible to photograph the house. I
      also freelance for life. It would be a marvellous scoop for me. " "that
      you must ask mr. Kahlenberg. But don't let us stand here in the sun. " tak
      moved to the jeep. "i will take you to the house. " gaye and garry got in
      the back seat and tak beside the driver. The zulu turned the jeep and sped
      back down the road. A few minutes later, gaye and garry were being ushered
      into a huge lounge which led through wide french windows to a flower
      ladened terrace with a big swimming-pool. The luxury of the room stunned
      garry who had never seen anything to compare with it and even impressed
      gaye who had been in many luxurious homes in her time. "if you would wait
      here, i will tell mr. Kahlenberg of your arrival. " a zulu in white drill
      came in silently. "have a drink please while you are waiting, " tak
      continued and then went away. The zulu went behind the bar and stood
      waiting. They asked for two gin and tonics and then moved out on to the
      terrace. "i don't like the look of that guy, " garry said in a low
      whisper. "there's something about him . . . " "yes. He gives me the
      creeps. He looks as if he sleeps in a coffin. " "don't you think we got in
      very easily? " garry went on, pulling up a basket chair for gaye and then
      sitting down himself. "it's my charm. " gaye smiled. "i'm irresistible to
      spooks. The chances are we will be thrown out as soon as mr. K. Hears we
      have arrived. Tak must be hiswill be thrown out as soon as mr. K. Hears we
      have arrived. Tak must be his major-domo or secretary i suppose. " the
      zulu brought the drinks with two plates of delicious looking canapes and
      silently withdrew. "what a gorgeous way to live! " gaye sighed. "i adore
      this place. Wouldn't you love to own it? " garry sipped his drink, then
      shook his head. "not for me. I like something a bit more rugged. This is
      too lush. " "oh, no! " she helped herself to a cracker covered with
      caviar. "i think it is marvellous. " they had eaten most of the canapes
      and had finished their drinks before tak appeared again. "mr. Kahlenberg
      is happy to have you here, miss desmond, " he said. "unfortunately, he is
      tied up with a series of long distance calls and other business and won't
      be free to meet you until tonight. Is it possible for you to stay? " "you
      mean . . . Stay the night? " gaye asked, looking up at the pale face.
      "certainly. That is what mr. Kahlenberg suggests. " "but i have no clothes
      with me. " "that is no problem. We have a number of women secretaries
      here. One of them will gladly lend you something. " "how nice! Did you ask
      him if i could take photographs? " tak shook his head. "i thought it would
      come better if the request came from you, miss desmond. ""i thought it
      would come better if the request came from you, miss desmond. " "well,
      then we will stay the night. It is very kind of mr. Kahlenberg. " "it will
      be his pleasure. " tak glanced at his watch. "lunch will be served in an
      hour. Perhaps you would care to change? " as they got to their feet, tak
      turned to garry. "you too, of course, have no clothes with you, mr.
      Edwards? " "only what i've got on. " "that can be arranged. " tak turned
      as miah came out on to the terrace. "this is miss das. She will take care
      of you both. If you will excuse me now, " and with a stiff little bow, tak
      left them. Miah came forward. "please follow me. " she led them across the
      lounge into a wide corridor that stretched away into the far distance.
      What looked like an electric golf cart stood nearby and she slid under the
      driving wheel while the other two took the rear seats. "this corridor is
      so long, " she said, turning to smile at them, "we have to use this to
      save our legs. " "i was wondering how you managed, " gaye returned. "when
      i saw the house from the air, i thought of the tremendous amount of
      walking it must make. " silently the trolley took them quickly past many
      closed doors until they reached the far end. "this is the guest wing, "
      miah said, stopping the car. She walked to a door and opened it. "please
      come in. " they entered a long narrow luxuriously furnished room which led
      on to a small terrace, also with a swimming-pool and a bar. Terrace, also
      with a swimming-pool and a bar. "you will find everything you want here, "
      miah said. "your lunch will be served on the terrace at 13.00 hrs. This is
      your bedroom, miss desmond. " she crossed the room and opened a door. "i
      will send a maid to help you dress. I thought it would be the easiest
      thing for you to wear one of my saris. Would that be all right? " "it
      would be perfect. " gaye stood in the doorway looking into the bedroom. It
      was a delightful room, decorated in pale-blue with a king's size bed,
      closets, a big dressing-table on which stood a variety of face creams,
      lotions, perfumes and a make-up kit in a flat, silver box. Moving around
      the room, gaye saw on the opposite wall, facing the bed a huge mirror
      which made the room seem to be twice its size. The bathroom was equipped
      with every luxury, including a sun lamp, a cabinet equipped with nozzles
      from which hot air could be released thus saving the fatigue of drying
      oneself on a towel, and a vibro-massage machine. While gaye was exclaiming
      over the room, garry was moving around the sitting-room, making a careful
      examination of the doors and windows. Miah came to show him his bedroom
      and bathroom, both of them as luxurious as gaye's. A tall zulu maid came
      in carrying the sari. Gaye said she didn't need her help and could manage
      on her own. A zulu manservant brought garry a pair of white slacks,
      heelless slippers and a white shirt. "mr. Kahlenberg is quite informal, "
      miah said. "dinner tonight will be on the main terrace. Please make
      yourselves at home. If you wish to swim, there are swim suits in the
      changing-room. Do explore the garden. If there is anything you wish for,
      please use the telephone. " with a nod of her head and a smile, she left
      the room. Gaye and garry looked at each other and garry whistled. "talk
      about living it up . . There came a tap on the door and a zulu came in
      with their rucksacks. These he set on the floor and withdrew. Garry went
      quickly to his rucksack and satisfied himself the two-way radio hadn't
      been removed. He looked at gaye. Hadn't been removed. He looked at gaye.
      "i wonder if they spotted this? " "it doesn't matter if they did, does it?
      " gaye's mind was occupied with the luxury surrounding her. Her eyes
      shining, she went on, "isn't it really marvellous! I'm taking a bath. See
      you later. " picking up her rucksack, she went into her bedroom and shut
      the door. She quickly undressed. Naked, she stood for a moment admiring
      herself in the big mirror, then she went into the bathroom and turned on
      the bath taps. Again while waiting for the bath to fill, she regarded
      herself in the mirror, striking poses and laughing happily to herself.
      What she didn't realize was that both the big mirrors were twoway: anyone
      behind the mirrors could see her as if the mirrors were plain glass,
      whereas from the front she imagined the mirrors were genuine and not trick
      ones. His affairs forgotten, his desk neglected, kahlenberg sat in his
      wheelchair in a narrow passage which was air conditioned and took his fill
      of gaye's naked beauty. From the edge of the jungle, fennel watched the
      helicopter land. He and ken had found a vantage point on a big balancing
      rock, formed by soil erosion, surrounded by trees and bushes, yet giving
      them an excellent view of kahlenberg's house, garden and airfield far
      below them. Fennel had powerful field glasses to his eyes. He saw tak
      arrive in the jeep and gaye meet him. He watched gaye and garry get into
      the jeep and drive to the house. He saw them enter and the front door
      close. "good for them! They're in! " he said, lowering the glasses. "that
      was pretty easy, wasn't it? " ken asked, puzzled. "from what i hear of
      kahlenberg, he doesn't welcome strangers. " "shalik said he was a sucker
      for a glamour puss. Looks like shalik knew what he was talking about.
      ""yes . . . But i didn't think it would be that easy. " ken picked up the
      two-way radio. "i'll keep this switched on. Garry may be coming through
      any time now. " fennel lit a cigarette and stretched out on the rock. He
      was feeling tired after the long walk, carrying his tool bag. He dozed
      while ken kept watch. After some little time, fennel sat up, lit a
      cigarette, yawned, then asked, "when you've got the money, what are you
      going to do with it? " "a pal of mine in jo'burg is starting a travel
      agency, " ken told him. "he needs more capital. I'm going into partnership
      with him. " "travel agency? Is that so hot? " "it's good. We plan a de
      luxe service. Personally conducted tours around the game reserves. That's
      where i'll score. There's a lot of money in it. The americans are heavy
      spenders if you give them real personal service. I've been dealing with
      them for some years. I know what they want, and i plan to give it to them.
      " fennel grunted. "sounds like hard work to me. I don't believe in work.
      Only suckers work. " "so what are you going to do with your share? "
      "spend it . . . That's what money is for. I've got no time for the punks
      who save their money. What happens? They kick off and some other punk gets
      it. " "maybe that's what they want. " "to hell with that! There's always
      money around. When i've spent what i get from shalik, i'll do another
      little job. I've got plenty of contacts. They know i'm good so i'm never
      short of a job. " ken held up his hand, cutting him short. He had heard a
      crackle on the two-way radio and he put the set to his ear. "ken . . . Hi,
      garry . . . Hearing you loud and clear . . . Over. " he listened for some
      moments while fennel watched him intently. "roger. Good luck. Out, " and
      he switched off. "well? " "they're staying the night, " ken told him.
      "kahlenberg seems pleased they dropped in. I must say that surprises me.
      Anyway, they are meeting him at 21.00 hrs. Garry says he'll call back at
      23.00 hrs. , and for us to stand by. " fennel grunted. He looked at his
      watch. It was just after midday. "you mean we stay on this goddamn rock
      for twelve hours? " "i guess so. We don't want to walk into any of the
      guards. I reckon it is safe up here. Let'seat. " he brought out the
      inevitable can of beans. "goddamn it! Isn't there anything else to eat
      except beans? " "steak pie . . . Want that? " "that's better than beans. "
      fennel brooded as ken searched in the rucksack for the can. "i bet those
      two are doing themselves well. " his mind dwelt on gaye and a vicious
      spurt of rage ran through him. Get this job over, he told himself, and
      then you fix her and you fix her good. "what's bitten you? " ken asked,
      seeing the savage expression on fennel's face. "nothing . . . How much
      longer are you going to take to open that can? " "i wish i knew we weren't
      going to be disturbed, " garry said. Gaye and he were sitting on the
      terrace after an excellent lunch served by two zulu waiters. Gaye was
      stretched out on a reclining chair, a cigarette between her fingers. Garry
      thought she looked lovely in the red and gold sari. It was the type of
      costume that suited her, and which he admired. "why? " gaye asked, looking
      at him. "obvious reasons, " garry returned with a grin. "i would take you
      into the bedroom. " she laughed. "when i too wish we knew we weren't going
      to be disturbed. " "could be embarrassing if mr. Tak arrived on the scene.
      " "it could. So instead, we had better do some work. " she sat up,
      crushing out her cigarette. "have you thought about how fennel is to get
      in? " "through here. " garry waved his hand to the big lounge. "with us
      here, he has only to walk in. " "would it be as easy as that? " "i think
      so. There could be guards patrolling the house at night. I don't see any
      of them around now. " "perhaps kahlenberg is so sure no one could get
      through the jungle, the house isn't guarded. " "want to take a look at the
      garden? " "not now. It will be terribly hot out there. " "then you take a
      nap . . . I'm going. " garry got to his feet. "you have more energy than i
      have. You'll be roasted. " "see you, " and with a wave of his hand, garry
      wandered off down the green cement path. She watched him go, then she
      closed her eyes and thought about him. When the job was done, they would
      all separate. She wondered what he would do. She would have liked to have
      had a long weekend with him in paris, and then say good-bye. She was
      twenty-six years of age, and she was sure shalik would continue to make
      use of her for at least five more years before he began to look around for
      a younger woman. She had no illusions about shalik. In those five years
      she would have made and saved enough money to give her complete
      independence and that was what she wanted more than anything else. To be
      financially free to live well, to travel and possibly get married. She
      considered the possibility of marrying garry, but decided it wouldn't work
      out. Although he attracted her physically, she knew she wasn't in love
      with him and also he hadn't her need for gracious living. Luxury was
      essential to her whereas it wasn't to him. No . . . He was a good bed
      companion, but nothing else. If she were to marry, she must find a man who
      was wealthy, intelligent, cultured and luxury loving. She knew this was a
      pipe dream for she had met many men inand luxury loving. She knew this was
      a pipe dream for she had met many men in her life, had many proposals of
      marriage, but there was always some snag, or was it that she valued her
      freedom too much? Anyway, pipe dreams were pleasant when lying in a
      comfortable chair in the shade, surrounded by luxury. She dozed off, and
      it was more than an hour later that garry, returning, awakened her. "want
      a drink, lazybones? " he asked, moving to the bar. She nodded, stretched
      and sat up. "find anything interesting? " "yes and no. There's no access
      to the far end of the house. " garry brought over two tom collins and sat
      down. "the path leading to it is guarded by a zulu who looks as if he's
      stepped right out of a movie. He was wearing a leopard skin, ostrich
      plumes and carried a shield and an assagai. He turned me back without
      trying to be polite. " "kahlenberg's quarters, i suppose. " "yes. Another
      thing: there's a big pool full of enormous crocodiles at the far end of
      the garden and sitting on surrounding trees are about ten well fed looking
      vultures. That corner of the garden gave me the creeps. " gaye laughed.
      "but why? " "just struck me it would be a marvellous place to dispose of a
      body. " she looked at him and seeing he was serious, she asked, "why
      should kahlenberg want to dispose of a body? " garry sipped his drink,
      then cradling the glass in his hand, shaking it slightly so the ice cubes
      tinkled, he shrugged. The ice cubes tinkled, he shrugged. "the atmosphere
      of the place made me think of it, but i'm uneasy about all this, gaye. I
      think we were invited in too easily. I don't like the look of tak. Once or
      twice while you were talking to him, i got the idea he was laughing at
      you. Particularly when you asked if this place was his. It struck me he
      knew you knew it belonged to kahlenberg. " "do you think he suspects us? "
      "i think he could. " "you don't think he guesses we are after the ring? "
      "i don't know, but i'm pretty sure he thinks we are phonies. " "so what do
      we do? " as if in answer to this question, garry saw tak coming along the
      path towards them. "here he is now, " he said, getting to his feet.
      "please don't let me disturb you, " tak said, approaching. There was a
      thin smile on his lips and his glittering eyes moved from garry to gaye.
      "did you enjoy your lunch? " "it was wonderful, thank you. " gaye gave him
      her most charming smile. "it really is lovely here. " "yes . . . It is
      very pleasant. " he paused, then went on, "miss desmond, would you be
      interested to see mr. Kahlenberg's museum? " although her heart skipped a
      beat, gaye kept her face mildly interested. "has mr. Kahlenberg a museum?
      " "mr. Kahlenberg is one of the most famous collectors in the world. " "i
      knew that, but i didn't know he had a museum. I thought . . . ""i knew
      that, but i didn't know he had a museum. I thought . . . " "he has a
      museum, and he wondered if it would interest you to see it. " "very much.
      I would love to see it. " "and you, mr. Edwards? " "sure . . . Thanks. "
      garry kept his expression dead-pan, but like gaye, he had been startled.
      Gaye got to her feet. "is it far from here? " again garry caught a jeering
      expression come into the dark eyes. It came and went so quickly unless he
      had been watching closely he wouldn't have seen it. "you are standing on
      it, " tak said. "you mean it is underground? " "that is correct. " "may i
      bring my camera, mr. Tak? " he shook his head. "i regret not. " he turned.
      "will you follow me, please? " he entered the lounge and walked into the
      corridor. Gaye and garry exchanged swift glances as they followed him.
      They all got into the electric trolley and tak drove down the long
      corridor, past the big lobby and front door of the house and on down the
      corridor. "here is where mr. Kahlenberg has his quarters, " he explained
      as they drove past several doors. He stopped the trolley by what appeared
      to be a blank wall and got out. Watching him closely, garry saw him put
      his fingers under the ledge of one of the big windows. The wall he was
      facing slid back to reveal double doors. As he approached these doors,
      they slid open. "mr. Kahlenberg is a cripple, " tak explained, regarding
      gaye. "all doors in his quarters are electronically controlled. This is
      the elevator that takes us down toquarters are electronically controlled.
      This is the elevator that takes us down to the museum. " the three entered
      the green satin lined cage. There were four different coloured buttons on
      the control panel. Garry watched tak press the green button and the
      elevator descended smoothly and silently. While it descended tak pressed
      the red button, paused, then pressed the yellow button. "what are all
      those buttons for, mr. Tak? " gaye asked innocently. "the green button
      controls the elevator. The yellow button turns on the lights in the museum
      and the red button turns off the alarm, " tak told her. "thank you . . .
      You're marvellously well equipped. " the doors slid back and they entered
      a cool, vaulted chamber. "would you wait here for a moment? " tak said and
      he crossed to a grey painted door. He spent a minute or so at the door,
      his hands busy, his body concealing what he was doing. Again garry looked
      at gaye, lifted his eyebrows, then looked away as tak turned. "the museum
      contains many priceless treasures, " he said. "we have taken every
      precaution against theft. This door that leads into the museum is armour
      plated and specially treated to make it impossible to cut into. The walls
      either side are five feet thick. The lock to the door is controlled by a
      time switch which is set every night at 22.00 hrs. And no one can open the
      door until 10.00 hrs. The following day. Please come in. " they followed
      him into a vast domed ceiling room, lit by diffused lighting. On the walls
      hung many pictures. Gaye recognized a rembrandt, several picassos and a
      number of renaissance masterpieces which she was sure she had seen in the
      uffizi, the vatican museum and the louvre. "these aren't the originals,
      mr. Tak? " she asked. "of course they are the originals. " tak frowned as
      if annoyed by such a question. "i told you mr. Kahlenberg has the finest
      private museum in the world. Question. "i told you mr. Kahlenberg has the
      finest private museum in the world. The inner room will amuse you more i
      think. " he led the way through the picture gallery and entered another
      vast room. In the middle of the room stood a four metre high buddha in
      shining gold. "this is an interesting piece, " tak went on. "it comes from
      bangkok. During the last war, the japanese, knowing it was in the city,
      searched for it, but the priests were too clever for them. They moved it
      to a lesser temple and covered it with dirty cement. Although the japanese
      visited this temple they failed to recognize what they were looking for. "
      "you mean this is solid gold? " garry said, gaping at the glittering
      figure. "yes, it is solid gold. " he led them around the room, pausing to
      explain various objets d'art. Garry had no knowledge of art treasures, but
      even he was impressed by what he saw. "but surely that is one of the
      panels of ghiberti's gates to paradise, " gaye said, pausing before a
      beautifully carved panel on the wall. "what a wonderful copy! " "the copy
      is in florence, miss desmond. This is the original, " tak said, an acid
      note in his voice. "and this statue of david by bernini is also the
      original. The copy is in the bargello in florence. " gaye was so startled
      by the effrontery of this remark, that she turned away. It was then she
      caught sight of the caesar borgia ring in a small glass box on a pedestal
      in the lighted alcove. "and what is this? " she asked, moving to the glass
      box and peering at the ring. "the caesar borgia ring, " tak said. "it was
      made by an unknown goldsmith at borgia's request. It is a poison ring and
      so the story goes, the goldsmith was its first victim. To test its
      efficiency and to stop the man from talking, borgia gave him his fatal
      handshake while wearing the ring. There is a needle hidden in the cluster
      of diamonds and this scratched the victim's hand while he was shaking
      hands with borgia. Ingenious, don't you think? " "those were cruel,
      horrible times, " gaye said with a little grimace. "is it dangerous now? "
      "oh no, miss desmond. It would have to be recharged with poison before it
      could be dangerous, and i doubt if the needle is now sharp enough to
      scratch. " he led them on, showing them a beautiful alabaster unguent jar
      which he toldhe led them on, showing them a beautiful alabaster unguent
      jar which he told them came from the tomb of tutankhamen. They spent a
      further half-hour in the museum and then tak, looking at his watch,
      suggested they might like a drink before dinner. He led them from the
      museum, closed the door and garry watched him spin the dial, scrambling
      the combination; then they took the elevator up to the corridor. He drove
      them back to their suite and after accepting their thanks, said a servant
      would conduct them to the main terrace in an hour and a half and left
      them. The time now was 19.3o hrs. And they both went out on to the
      terrace. "i want something short and strong, " gaye said sitting down. "a
      vodka martini on the rocks. " "i'll dig for that too. " garry began to mix
      the drink. He filled two cocktail glasses and carried them over to the
      table and sat down. Did you spot the tv snoopers in both rooms? " "no . .
      . Did you? " "yes. Fennel said there were six monitors and therefore six
      rooms in the museum. Tak only showed us two of the rooms. You know, gaye
      i'm liking this less and less. I have an idea we could have walked into a
      trap. " gaye looked startled. "surely not! He wouldn't have shown us what
      he did if he is really suspicious of us. " "that's what puzzles me. He
      must realize we have guessed most of those exhibits have been stolen. Then
      why did he let us see them? Why did he tell us how the elevator works and
      about the time lock? He must know we will talk about this visit when we
      leave unless . . . " he paused, frowning, then shook his head. "unless . .
      . What? " "unless he's not going to let us leave. " gaye stiffened. "he
      can't keep us forever. Garry, do talk sense. " garry sipped his drink.
      "all right, but i don't like it. If fennel and ken weren't out there, i'd
      be worried. I'm going to talk to them. " he got up and went into his
      bedroom. Gaye waited. She was also puzzled that tak had taken them into
      the museum, but she wasn't worried. She told herself that kahlenberg was
      so confident about his safety precautions, he didn't mind strangers seeing
      his museum. Garry returned after some twenty minutes. "fennel agrees it
      looks suspicious. Themba has been left guarding the equipment. Fennel is
      coming here on his own, leaving ken to keep watch. If kahlenberg starts
      trouble, at least ken can do something to help us. When we get the ring,
      we'll signal ken and we'll all meet at the airfield and take off. We'll
      pick up themba and get back to mainville. " "do you think kahlenberg will
      start trouble? " "i'll tell you when i've met him, " garry returned. "how
      about another drink? " at exactly 21.00 hrs. , a zulu servant came to take
      them to the main terrace. Seated in his chair, kahlenberg was waiting for
      them. He greeted them pleasantly and waved them to chairs near him. "tak
      tells me you are from animal world, miss desmond. " he said, after gaye
      had thanked him for receiving them. "have you been with them long? " "not
      very . . . Six months. " "it is a magazine i take regularly. I am
      interested in animals. Why don't they give you a credit line, miss
      desmond? " watching, garry was relieved to see gaye was cool and seemed
      quite at ease. She laughed a little ruefully. "i am one of the small fry,
      mr. Kahlenberg. I do the routine work. I was hoping you would allow me to
      photograph this lovely house. I would get a credit for that. "that. " he
      studied her. "i am afraid then you will have to wait a little longer for
      your credit. Photography is forbidden here. " she met his blue-grey eyes,
      smiling. "even to me? I promise i will be most discreet and photograph
      only the house and the garden. " "i am sorry. " he changed the subject by
      asking if she found his museum interesting. "it is magnificent. I
      congratulate you. " three zulus came silently on to the terrace and stood
      waiting before a beautifully laid table. At the same time, hindenburg who
      had just finished his dinner, came slowly across the terrace to
      kahlenberg. "what a beauty! " gaye exclaimed. "may i stroke him? " "it
      would be unwise, " kahlenberg said, rubbing the cheetah's ear. "my pet is
      a little uncertain with strangers . . . Even beautiful strangers, miss
      desmond. " he set his chair in motion and drove up to the table. "let us
      have dinner. " when they were seated, kahlenberg turned to garry. "and
      you, mr. Edwards, have you been a professional pilot for long? " garry
      shook his head. "just started, " he said easily. "miss desmond is my first
      client. Of course i've done a lot of chopper flying in the states, but i
      like a change, so i've set up business in durban. " "i see. " iced melons
      were served. Iced melons were served. "you are after big game, miss
      desmond? " "yes. We were on our way to wannock game reserve when saw this
      wonderful house and i felt i had to see more of it. I do hope you don't
      think i was presumptuous. " "not at all. If i didn't wish you to be here,
      tak would have sent you away. No, it is a pleasure to have such unexpected
      guests. " "you are certainly out in the wilds . . . Don't you find it
      lonely? " she asked. "when one is as busy as i am, one hasn't time to feel
      lonely. It surprises me that you are a photographer. " kahlenberg looked
      directly at her. "i should have thought by the way you walk and by your
      appearance that you would have been a model. " "i have done modelling, but
      i find photography more interesting. " "i too am interested in photography
      in an amateurish sort of way. I suppose you work entirely in colour? "
      gaye who had only the haziest knowledge of photography, realized they were
      getting on to dangerous ground. "yes, i work in colour. " "tell me, miss
      desmond . . . " kahlenberg began when the second course of blue trout was
      served. Gaye immediately began to enthuse about the fish, hoping to change
      the subject. "it's my favourite fish, " she told him. "how fortunate, but
      i was . . . " garry too had seen the red light and he tried to steer the
      conversation into another channel. "mr. Kahlenberg, i took a walk in your
      wonderful garden and came across a zulu in full war dress . . . At least,
      i think it is war dress from what i've seen on the movies . . . A
      magnificent specimen. "the movies . . . A magnificent specimen. " "yes, i
      have over a hundred of these men, " kahlenberg said. "i like them to dress
      in their traditional costume. They are great hunters of beasts . . . And
      of men. They are the guardians of my estate. No one approaches here
      without being seen and turned back. They patrol the surrounding jungle day
      and night in shifts. " "not the garden? " garry asked casually as he could
      as he removed the back bone of the fish. There was such a long pause that
      he glanced up to find kahlenberg's eyes on him. The amused contempt in
      those eyes made garry look quickly down at his fish. "no, mr. Edwards,
      they don't patrol the garden at night, but i have a few of them in the
      garden during the day when there are strangers here. " "well, they are
      certainly impressive, " garry said, laying down his knife and fork. "that
      was excellent. " "yes, " kahlenberg absently reached out his hand and
      began to stroke hindenberg's rough fur. The cheetah began to purr. "what a
      marvellous sound, " gaye exclaimed. "have you had him long? " "a little
      over three years. We are inseparable. " kahlenberg looked over at garry.
      "he is a magnificent watch-dog or i suppose i should say watch-cat. I had
      good proof of this a few months ago. One of my servants went mad and tried
      to attack me. He came into my office with a knife, but before he could
      even reach me, hindenberg had literally torn him to pieces. The cheetah is
      the fastest moving animal on earth. Did you know that, mr. Edwards? "
      garry eyed the cheetah and shook his head. "he looks as if he could give a
      good account of himself. " "he can. " one of the waiters presented the
      main course which was a chicken browned in a casserole, the rib cage
      removed and the bird stuffed with diced lobster in a cream sauce, coloured
      by the coral of the lobster. "ah! This is something out of the ordinary, "
      kahlenberg said. "i got the recipe from one of the great paris chefs. I
      think you will find it excellent. "from one of the great paris chefs. I
      think you will find it excellent. " while the waiter was carving the
      chicken, kahlenberg chatted agreeably, but both gaye and garry could see
      his mind was only half with them. He was obviously occupied with some
      business problem and wasn't giving them his entire attention. The chicken
      was excellent as kahlenberg had said it would be, and both of them
      expressed their appreciation. Although the food was delicious, gaye was
      relieved when the meal was over. She found she had to work hard to hold
      kahlenberg's interest. She was used to mixing with difficult people, but
      she mentally decided kahlenberg was the stickiest host she bad ever met.
      He was polite, but distant and she knew she had only half his attention.
      But she kept the conversation going, avoiding dangerous topics, asked
      questions about himself, discussed new york, paris and london with him
      while garry kept more or less silent, admiring her persistance. As they
      were drinking coffee, tak come out on to the terrace. He went up to
      kahlenberg. "excuse me, sir, mr. Vorster is on the telephone. " kahlenberg
      frowned. "oh, yes, i had forgotten. Tell him i will call back in five
      minutes. " tak bowed and went away. "i must apologize, miss desmond, but i
      regret i will now have to leave you to your own devices. I have work to
      do. I doubt if we will meet again before you leave. I am sorry about the
      photographs. I hope you enjoyed your dinner. " they got to their feet and
      both thanked him for his hospitality. He looked at them with an odd
      expression in his eyes, nodded, then set his chair in motion and drove off
      the terrace, followed by hindenburg. Reaching his office, he found tak
      waiting for him. "thank you, tak, those two were beginning to bore me.
      Lovely looking woman, of course, but a play thing. " he manoeuvred himself
      behind his desk. "they are being watched? ""yes, sir. " "good. And the
      other three? " "the guide no longer exists. Fennel and jones are on the
      balancing rock watching through field glasses. They have been in contact
      with edwards by two- way radio. Their conversation was intercepted. Fennel
      is coming here on his own, leaving jones where he is. Edwards thinks we
      suspect him and is taking precautions. " "very wise of him. All right,
      tak, you can go to your bungalow. I have some work to do, but intend to
      retire at my usual time. The rest of the staff can go. " tak hesitated.
      "is it wise, sir? " "the guards will be here and hindenberg. Yes, it is
      all right. " kahlenberg looked thoughtfully at tak. "it is much wiser that
      you don't have anything to do with this little affair. Good night. " "good
      night, sir, " and tak went away. Kahlenberg settled down to read a mass of
      papers that had come by the afternoon air delivery. A little after half
      past ten, there came a soft tap on the door, frowning, he called, "come
      in. " kemosa entered. "what is it? " "zwide, one of the gardeners, master,
      is dead. " kahlenberg raised his eyebrows. "dead? How did it happen? An
      accident? " "i do not know, master. He complained of a headache and pains
      in his muscles. "i do not know, master. He complained of a headache and
      pains in his muscles. As he is always complaining, no one took any notice.
      Later he said his throat was on fire. A few minutes later, he fell down
      and died. " "extraordinary thing. Well, bury him, kemosa. I dare say his
      wife will be pleased. He is no loss. " kemosa eyed his master, then bowed.
      "i will have it done, master, " and he went out, closing the door softly
      behind him. Kahlenberg sat back in his chair. A little smile that gave him
      a devilish expression lit up his face. So the borgia ring was lethal.
      Chapter eight when gaye and garry returned to their suite, they found all
      the windows and the doors leading to the terrace closed and the air
      conditioner in operation. Garry went immediately to the terrace doors and
      tried to open them, but they were securely locked and the key had been
      removed. When he tried to open one of the windows, he found it immovable.
      "battened down for the night, " he said, scratching his head. Now, how the
      hell is fennel going to get in? " "i thought you were being over
      optimistic. Is it likely they would leave all this open at night? " gaye
      asked, sitting on the arm of a lounging chair. "what are you going to do?
      " "alert fennel. It's his job to get in. Maybe he can cope with this lock.
      " garry looked at his watch. The time was 22.00 hrs. He sat down and
      looked across at gaye. "we have an hour to wait. What did you think of
      kahlenberg? " gaye grimaced. "i didn't like him. I think he was bored with
      me and a man wh0 finds me boring can't expect to be my favourite person. "
      she laughed. "what did you think of him? " "he's dangerous, " garry said
      soberly. "i'll go further than that. I get the feeling, watching him, he
      isn't quite sane. I still have the idea we have walked into a trap. But as
      we're here, we'd be nuts not to have a go at the ring. I wonder if he was
      lying when he said the grounds weren't patrolled at night. I'll have to
      warn fennel to be careful as he comes. " "you don't think he's sane . . .
      What do you mean? " "there's something about his eyes . . . I'm not saying
      he is mad, but off balance. " "i'm sure you're imagining all this, garry.
      I can't believe he could have let us see the museum if he really suspected
      us. I think he is soured by being a cripple, and if he was distant, then
      it was probably due to that . . . For all you know, he may be in pain. "be
      in pain. " "you could be right, " garry shrugged. "but the whole set-up
      seems to me too easy. " "are you going to check on the elevator? " "of
      course. If it isn't working, i don't see how we can get at the door of the
      museum. I'll wait half an hour, then i'll go out and see. " he got up,
      crossed to the door and opened it. He looked down the deserted corridor.
      It was lighted, and in the far distance he could see the end of it
      terminating in double doors. "no one about. " he returned to the lounge,
      closing the door. "could be tricky. If tak or one of the servants come out
      of any of those rooms while i'm out there, i'm fixed. A fly couldn't hide
      out there. " "you can always say you're walking in your sleep. " garry
      frowned at her. "i wish you would take this more seriously. You don't seem
      to realize if we're caught we could be in a very nasty situation. " "let's
      worry about that if and when it happens. " garry suddenly grinned. "i
      guess you're right. Come here and be kissed. " she shook her head. "not
      now . . . We're working. " he hesitated, then lighting a cigarette, he
      dropped into a chair. "if we get away with this, what are you going to do
      with the money, gaye? " he asked. "save it. I save all my money and invest
      it at six per cent in a swiss bank. Soon, i'll have a nice income and then
      shalik can look for another slave. " "you don't like him? ""you don't like
      him? " "who would? He's useful, but that's all. And you, what are you
      going to do with your share? " "take a course in electronics, " garry said
      promptly. "i've always wanted to have an education, and up to now, i've
      never had the chance. With shalik's money, i'll study, and then get myself
      a decent paying job. There are lots of opportunities in the electronics
      field. " "you surprise me . . . You don't strike me as the studious type.
      Do you plan to get married? " "yes, but not until i've qualified. Then i
      will. " "got the girl lined up yet? " he smiled at her. "yes, i think so.
      " "who is she? " "no one you know . . . Just a girl. We get along okay. "
      "i rather thought you were going to say me. " he laughed. "you would have
      said no anyway. " "why are you so sure? " "you would, wouldn't you? " gaye
      smiled at him. "yes. I wouldn't want to marry an electronics engineer.
      When i marry it will be a man who thinks big, lives big and is rich. " "i
      know that. That's why i'm picking toni. ""is that her name? " garry
      nodded. "i wish you luck, garry, and i hope you will be very happy with
      her. " "thanks. I hope you will be happy too, but don't pin too much on
      money. " gaye looked thoughtful. "life can be pretty rough without it. "
      "yes. " he stubbed out his cigarette and stared up at the ceiling. "one's
      got to have enough, of course, but all this . . . " he waved his hand
      around the luxuriously furnished room. "this isn't necessary. " "it is to
      me. " "that's where we differ. " he glanced at his watch. "i guess i'll
      take a look at the elevator. " gaye got to her feet. "i'll come with you.
      If we run into anyone, we can say we felt like a walk in the garden and as
      we couldn't get out through the terrace way we were going to try the front
      door. " "a bit thin . . . But it'll have to do. Let's go. " they moved
      silently out into the long corridor, paused to listen, heard nothing and
      then they walked fast down the corridor, passing the front door and on
      towards the hidden lift. Garry went to the window ledge and felt under it.
      His fingers found a button which he pressed. The wall slid back. They
      looked at each other, then motioning her to stay where she was, he
      approached the lift doors which swished silently open. He entered the
      cage, then first pressing the red button which tak had told him turned off
      the alarm, he then pressed the greenbutton which tak had told him turned
      off the alarm, he then pressed the green button. The doors closed and then
      the lift descended. When it reached ground level, garry pressed the green
      button again and the lift ascended. He stepped into the corridor and
      reclosed the sliding wall. Taking gaye's hand in his, he ran silently down
      the corridor and back to their suite. "well, it works, " he said, closing
      the door. Now everything depends on whether fennel can get in and then, of
      course, if he can open the door to the museum. " after waiting a quarter
      of an hour, garry picked up the two-way radio. Fennel answered
      immediately. Garry explained the situation and told fennel the elevator
      was working. Fennel said there were still lights showing in the windows of
      the two extreme wings of the house. "the light on the right is mine, "
      garry said. "the other light is from kahlenberg's quarters. " "the left
      wing light has gone out, " fennel reported. "the only light now showing is
      where you are. " "kahlenberg told me the grounds aren't patrolled, lew, "
      garry said, "but i don't trust him. Take your time and use every scrap of
      cover as you come. There could be some of the zulu guards around. " "i'll
      watch it. I'll start now. It'll take me a good half-hour to get to you.
      Ken will remain here until we signal him. " "roger . . . Out, " and garry
      switched off. Turning to gaye, he went on, "he's on his way now. All the
      other lights have gone out. " he crossed to the bedside lamps and turned
      them on, then he turned off the ceiling lights. Going to the window, he
      peered into the darkness. The big moon was partially hidden by clouds, but
      after a few moments, his eyes became used to the darkness and he could
      make out the terrace furniture and beyond the beds of flowers. "we could
      be flying back to mainville in a couple of hours, " gaye said. "i'm"we
      could be flying back to mainville in a couple of hours, " gaye said. "i'm
      going to change. " she went into the bedroom, took off the sari and put on
      her shirt and shorts. When she returned to the lounge, she found garry had
      also changed. They sat on the bed, looking through the window, waiting for
      fennel. The minutes dragged by. Both of them were keyed up as they sat,
      waiting. After what seemed an age, garry put his hand on gaye's arm. "he's
      here. " he got to his feet and went to the window. Fennel came out of the
      darkness and paused at the window and nodded. He lowered his tool kit to
      the ground and came to the terrace doors. With the aid of a pencil flash
      light, he examined the lock. Looking at garry, he jerked up his thumb,
      then reached for his tool kit. In a few minutes, the terrace doors swung
      open. Picking up his tool kit, fennel moved into the lounge. He ignored
      gaye as if she wasn't in the room. Turning to garry, he said, "been doing
      yourself well, huh? " he looked around the room. "ken and i certainly
      caught the crappy end of this stick, didn't we? " "tough, " garry said,
      smiling. "never mind. You'll recover. " fennel gave him an evil look, then
      turned away. Seeing the mood he was in, gaye watched him, but didn't
      speak. "where's the lift? " fennel asked. "this job could take me three or
      four hours. " garry turned to gaye. "you'd better stay here if it's going
      to take that long. " she nodded. "all right. " "how about the tv snoopers?
      " fennel asked. "they're there in the museum, but i've no idea where the
      monitor-room is or if anyone keeps watch at night. " fennel flushed with
      rage. "your job was to find out! " he snarled. Garry went to the door,
      opened it and beckoned to fennel. "take a look . . . There are about
      thirty-five doors down that corridor. It could be behind any one of them.
      We can't walk in and check. Did you see any zulus as you came through the
      garden? " "no. What's that to do with it? " "the chances are if they
      aren't patrolling the grounds, they don't keep watch at night on the tv
      monitor. " "if they do, we're sunk. " "there it is. Have you any ideas how
      we can check? " fennel thought, then shrugged. "it could be anywhere . . .
      Could be in one of the huts away from the house. " he hesitated. "it's
      taking a hell of a chance. " "we either take the chance or we leave
      without the ring. " "will you take the chance? " fennel demanded. "sure,
      if you will. " "then let's go. " they moved silently into the corridor,
      leaving gaye still sitting on the bed. A few minutes later, they were
      descending in the lift. When they reached the vaulted chamber, garry
      pointed to the tv lens in the ceiling. "there it is. " fennel moved under
      the lens and peered at it. Then he sucked in a deep breath. "it's not
      operating. ""sure? " "yeah. " garry wiped his sweating hands on the seats
      of his shorts. "there's the door to the museum. Do you want me to do
      anything? " fennel went to the door and examined the dial and the lock.
      "no . . . Just leave it to me. It's going to take time, but i can get it
      open. " he opened his tool kit and laid out a selection of tools on the
      floor. Garry went over to a high-backed leather chair and sat down. He lit
      a cigarette and tried to contain his impatience. Fennel worked carefully,
      whistling softly under his breath. His body concealed what he was doing,
      and after a while, garry got bored watching his broad back, and getting
      up, he began to pace up and down. He smoked one cigarette after another
      and continually looked at his watch. After an hour had dragged by, he
      paused in his pacing to ask. "how's it coming? " "i've neutralized the
      time switch, " fennel said, sitting back on his heels and wiping his
      forehead with his arm. "that's the worst part of the job behind us. Now,
      i've got to tackle the lock itself. " garry sat down and waited. Another
      hour dragged by, then fennel gave a little grunt. "i've done it! " he
      exclaimed. Garry joined him at the door. "quicker than you thought. "
      "just luck. I've been five hours on one of these goddamn locks before now.
      " he stood up and pulled the door open. "do you know where the ring is? "
      "i'll take you to it. " fennel hastily repacked his tool bag and together
      the two men moved into the picture gallery. Going ahead, garry entered the
      second room and made for thepicture gallery. Going ahead, garry entered
      the second room and made for the lighted alcove. Then he paused,
      experiencing a sense of shock. The pedestal was there, but the glass box
      and the ring were missing. "what is it? " fennel demanded. "it's gone! "
      garry licked his dry lips. "that's where it was . . . It's gone! I thought
      . . . " he stopped short as he saw fennel, his face twitching, was staring
      at the wide archway from which they had come into this room from the
      picture gallery. Standing in the archway, wearing only leopard skins, were
      four giant zulus, each holding a broad-bladed stabbing spear, their cruel,
      fierce black eyes fixed on the two startled men. One of them said in
      guttural english. "you come with us. " "what they call a fair cop, " garry
      said and moved towards the zulus. Fennel hesitated, but he knew they
      hadn't a chance against these four giants. Cursing softly, he picked up
      his tool bag and moved after garry. As the minutes crawled by, gaye became
      more and more uneasy and restless. She prowled around the luxurious lounge
      wondering how fennel was getting on. It was now nearly two hours since
      they had left the lounge. She kept telling herself fennel had said it
      might be a four hour job. She wished now she had gone with them. This long
      wait was getting on her nerves. Then she heard a gentle tap on the door.
      Thinking it was garry, she hastened across the lounge and opened the door.
      She was confronted by a zulu who towered above her, the overhead light
      making his black skin glisten and the blade of his assigai flash. She
      stifled a scream and stepped hurriedly back, her hand going to her mouth.
      The zulu glared at her, his eyes like wet stones. "you come with me, " he
      growled and *stepped aside. "what do you want? " gaye asked, her voice
      husky with shock. "what do you want? " gaye asked, her voice husky with
      shock. "the master wants you . . . Come! " she hesitated. So garry had
      been right after all, she thought, they had walked into a trap. By now she
      was recovering from her shock. There was nothing else to do but to obey,
      and lifting her head high, she walked out into the corridor. The zulu
      pointed to the double doors at the far end of the corridor with his
      assigai. She knew it was useless to try to escape so she walked down the
      corridor, followed by the zulu. When she finally reached the double doors,
      they swung open automatically. Without looking at the zulu, she walked
      into kahlenberg's office, her heart thumping and her mouth dry. At the far
      end of the vast room, kahlenberg was sitting at his desk, a cigarette
      between his fingers, hindenburg at his side. "ah, miss desmond, " he said,
      looking up. "please come and join me. I am watching something of great
      interest. " as she moved around the desk, she saw the small tv set was on.
      Kahlenberg waved to a chair near his, away from hindenburg who hadn't
      taken his eyes off her since she had entered the room. "sit down and look
      at this. " she sat down, folding her hands in her lap and looked at the
      lighted screen. Her heart skipped a beat as she saw fennel kneeling in
      front of the door leading to the museum. "i believe he is actually
      defeating my beautiful lock, " kahllenberg said. "the makers assured me no
      one could do it. " fennel suddenly sat back on his heels. "i've done it! "
      he exclaimed. His voice, slightly muffled, came through the speaker well
      enough. Then garry moved into the picture. "your friend is clever, "
      kahlenberg said. Although he spoke mildly, his eyes glittered angrily. "i
      didn't believe he could do it, but as you see, he has done it. " gaye said
      nothing. "usually, we immobilize the lift, " kahlenberg went on, leaning
      back in his chair, his eyes still on the screen. "but i was interested to
      see if this expert could break in. I will have to talk seriously with the
      makers. This won't do at all. " they watched fennel and garry enter the
      museum. The picture changed to another angle as kahlenberg reached forward
      and pressed a button on the set. "i didn't want to alarm your friends so i
      didn't operate this set until they were satisfied it wasn't operating, "
      kahlenberg went on. Now i fear they are in for a disappointment and a
      surprise. " the picture showed the two men staring at the pedestal in the
      lighted alcove. Gaye heard fennel say, "what is it? " leaning forward,
      kahlenberg turned off the set. "they will be here in a few minutes, miss
      desmond, " he said. He reached for a gold cigarette box and offered it. "a
      cigarette? " "thank you. " gaye took a cigarette and accepted a light. "by
      the way, how is mr. Shalik? " if he had expected to startle her, he was
      disappointed. Her face was expressionless as she said, "last time i saw
      him, he seemed very well. " "he continues to concoct his miserable little
      swindles? " "i really don't know. He always seems to be busy, but just
      what he does i have no idea. " "it is time he was stopped for good. " the
      flash of fire in kahlenberg's eyes made her remember that garry had
      thought this man was unbalanced. "he is developing into a nuisance. " "do
      you think so? I should have thought he is no more of a nuisance than
      others, " gaye said coolly. "after all, mr. Kahlenberg, surely you are
      birds of a feather? "feather? " kahlenberg's eyes narrowed slightly. "what
      makes you say that, miss desmond? " "mr. Tak tells me everything in your
      museum is an original. I don't imagine the authorities of florence would
      have sold you the ghiberti panel or the bernini david. I do know you stole
      the borgia ring. Surely you are just as much a nuisance to the curators of
      various museums as mr. Shalik is to you. " kahlenberg smiled. "yes, i
      admit everything in my museum has been stolen, but there is a reason. I
      appreciate beautiful things. I need beauty. I am too busy to visit europe
      so i prefer to have my beauty here where i can see it when i have the
      inclination. But shalik only plots for money, not beauty. He lives for
      money as i live for beauty. I intend to stop him. " "perhaps he needs the
      money, " gaye said. "you have more than enough. Perhaps you would be like
      mr. Shalik if you had no money. " kahlenberg crushed out his cigarette.
      She could see he was controlling his temper only with an effort. "you are
      a spirited woman, miss desmond. I am sure mr. Shalik would be flattered to
      hear you defending him. " "i am not defending him. I am just saying i see
      no difference between you and him, " gaye said quietly. At this moment the
      double doors swung open and garry and fennel walked in. The four zulus
      paused in the doorway, looking towards kahlenberg who dismissed them with
      a wave of his hand. They stepped back and the doors closed. "come in,
      gentlemen and sit down, " kahlenberg said, waving to chairs opposite his
      desk. "as you see, miss desmond has already joined me. " garry went to a
      chair and folded himself down into it, but fennel remained standing,
      glaring at kahlenberg. "please sit down, mr. Fennel, " kahlenberg said
      quietly. "let me congratulate you. I didn't believe it was possible for
      anyone to open the door to my museum and yet you have done it. It is an
      achievement. " "you can cut out the soft soap! " fennel snarled. We came
      for the ring and we haven't got it so now we're getting the hell out of
      here and you're not stopping us! " "certainly you shall leave, "
      kahlenberg said, "but we have something to discuss first. " "i'm not
      discussing anything with you! " fennel snapped. He was livid with rage and
      disappointment. He looked at gaye and garry. "come on . . . He daren't
      stop us. " and he started towards the door, grabbed the handle but found
      the door locked. He spun around, glaring at kahlenberg. "open this door or
      i'll break your goddamn neck! " kahlenberg raised his eyebrows. "that
      could be dangerous for you, mr. Fennel, " he said and made a soft clicking
      sound with his tongue against his teeth. Immediately, hindenburg stood up
      and began to move slowly forward, his eyes on fennel, his lips off his
      teeth in a ferocious snarl that made fennel back away. "i assure you, "
      kahlenberg went on, "my pet would tear you to pieces if i give him another
      signal. Sit down! " cowed by the cheetah, fennel sat down abruptly by
      garry. "thank you, " kahlenberg said, then went on, "i don't want the
      effort you three have made to get the borgia ring to be wasted. As miss
      desmond has rightly pointed out, the ring doesn't legally belong to me.
      Since you all have shown so much initiative in getting as far as you have,
      i have decided to give you the ring on certain conditions. " he opened the
      drawer in his desk and took out the glass box, containing the ring. He
      placed the box on his desk where the three could see it. Fennel glared at
      the ring and then looked at garry. "is that it? " and when garry nodded,
      fennel turned to kahlenberg. "what do you mean . . . Conditions? "
      kahlenberg addressed himself to gaye. "miss desmond, although i live in
      considerable luxury, although i am an"miss desmond, although i live in
      considerable luxury, although i am an exceedingly busy man, there are
      times when i get very bored with myself. As you see, i am a cripple. I am
      chained to this chair. One of my ambitions when young was to be a hunter.
      Nothing would have given me more satisfaction than to go on safari. But
      being a cripple, this has been impossible and i admit to a certain
      frustration. Any form of frustration to a man of my power and wealth is
      intolerable. " "what the hell is this? " fennel demanded impatiently.
      "what are these conditions you are talking about? " kahlenberg ignored
      him. "here is the borgia ring. " he picked up the glass box and handed it
      to gaye. "i understand each of you will be paid nine thousand dollars when
      you hand the ring to shalik. " he smiled bleakly. "you see, i have an
      excellent spy system. Nine thousand dollars to you is important money and
      naturally it will give you incentive to deliver the ring to shalik. " "you
      mean you are giving us the ring? " fennel demanded. "miss desmond already
      has it. I am now going to give you a further incentive . . . A much more
      important one . . . To deliver the ring to shalik. But in spite of these
      two incentives, you still have to get the ring out of my estate. " "so
      that's it, " fennel's eyes narrowed. "your savages are going to stop us .
      . . Is that it? " "if they can they will. I am going to arrange a hunt.
      You three and mr. Jones who is waiting for you will be the hunted and my
      zulus will be the hunters. You must regard it as exciting a game as i
      shall. You will have a reasonable chance to escape the hunters because i
      am going to give you a three hour start. You will leave here at 04.00 hrs.
      When it will be light enough for you to make good speed and you will need
      good speed. At 07.00 hrs. My zulus will come after you. It will be
      entirely up to your speed and ingenuity to avoid them. " "are you serious?
      " garry asked. "certainly i am very serious as you will discover should
      you be unfortunate enough to be captured. ""suppose we are captured? What
      happens? " kahlenberg inclined his head. "a sensible question, mr.
      Edwards. If you are captured, you will be cruelly put to death. My men are
      extremely primitive. In the days of shaka, the famous zulu chief, when he
      caught his enemies, he had them impaled. This is done by hammering a
      sharpened skewer into the lower intestine and leaving the victim to die
      slowly and in extreme agony. " garry's face tightened. "and your savages
      would do that to us if they caught us? " he asked. "yes, they would. "
      there was a long pause, then garry said, "so you are staging this hunt to
      pander to your perverted, sadistic frustration. Is that it? " kahlenberg's
      face changed: from a courteous, mild spoken man he turned suddenly into a
      cruel, vicious looking lunatic. "i am going to teach you not to trespass
      on my estate, " he said, leaning forward and glaring at garry. "you have
      dared to come here with your ridiculous tale and now you will pay for it!
      " he gained control of himself and sat back, his mouth working and he
      remained motionless until his rage died down. "it is necessary to get rid
      of you all since you have seen my museum. It is essential that you don't
      escape to talk. " a little shaken to realize that his idea that kahlenberg
      was mentally unbalanced was now confirmed, garry said, "then why give us
      the ring? Why not call your men in and kill us now? " "the hunt will amuse
      me. You have the ring because if you do happen to escape, you deserve to
      keep it . . . But i assure you, it is unlikely you will escape. " "suppose
      we give you our word not to talk and leave the ring with you? " garry
      said. "would you allow us to use the helicopter and fly out? " "no, and in
      case you are hoping to use your helicopter, i will tell you at once that
      it is under guard. Ten of my zulus surround it and tomorrow early, one of
      my pilots will fly it back to the company you hired it from. " he pressed
      a button on his desk and a panel slid back on the opposite wall revealing
      a relief map of the estate and the house. "i will give you a reasonable
      chance and i would bethe estate and the house. "i will give you a
      reasonable chance and i would be disappointed if the hunt were over in a
      few hours. I would like it to last several days. So please look at the map
      and study it. You will see the exit from the east is blocked by a range of
      mountains. Unless you are all expert rock climbers, i wouldn't advise you
      to go that way. I will warn you my zulus think nothing of scrambling down
      the mountainside of these dangerous heights and they would quickly catch
      up with you. Nor would i recommend the exit to the south. As you can see
      from the map there is a river there, but what isn't shown is that the
      approaches to the river is swamp land and infested by crocodiles and some
      of the most deadly snakes in natal. The north exit is straightforward.
      That is the way you came in. However, twenty of my zulus are always
      guarding that approach. You didn't see them as you came in, mr. Fennel,
      but they saw you and mr. Jones and were continually reporting your
      progress. So i would advise you not to leave that way as although they let
      you in on my instructions, you may be sure they won't let you out. So this
      leaves only the west. It is not easy, but possible. You will find no water
      there, but there is a good jungle track that leads finally to the main
      highway to mainville. It is some hundred and twenty kilometres and you
      would need to hurry. A zulu can easily keep pace with a fast moving horse,
      but you do have a three hour start. " kahlenberg looked at his watch. "it
      is past my bed time. Please return to the guest suite and get a little
      rest. At 04.00 hrs. You will be released. Again i advise you to move as
      quickly as you can. " he pressed a button on his desk and the doors
      opened. The four waiting zulus came in. "please go with these men, "
      kahlenberg continued. "there is an old african saying which you will all
      do well to remember. It is that the vulture is a patient bird. Personally
      i would prefer a vulture to one of my zulus. Good night. " back in the
      guest suite and when fennel closed the door, garry said, "he's a
      pathological case. I had a feeling about him the moment i saw him. Do you
      think he's bluffing about the zulus? " "no. " gaye suppressed a shiver.
      "he is a sadistic pervert. That expression on his face when he let the
      mask drop! Let's go now, garry. They think the terrace doors are locked.
      We might gain seven hours if we leave at once. " garry went to the terrace
      doors and opened them. He paused, then stepped back, closing the doors.
      "they are out there already . . . Waiting. " gaye joined him and peered
      through the glass. She could see a half-circle of squatting zulus, facing
      her: the moonlight glittered on their spears, their ostrichsquatting
      zulus, facing her: the moonlight glittered on their spears, their ostrich
      plumes moved in the slight breeze. Feeling frightened, she moved away from
      the doors and sat down. "what are we going to do, garry? " "are you any
      good on a mountain? " garry asked, coming to sit by her side. "i don't
      think so. . . . I've never tried. " "you can cut the mountains out, "
      fennel said, wiping his face with the back of his arm. "i've no head for
      heights. " "we'll have to consult ken. We have to start north to pick
      themba up. Without him, we're not going to get out. " "that's right, "
      fennel said. "ken says that the guy has a compass in his head. He'll get
      us out. " "let's have a drink. " garry got to his feet and went over to
      the bar. "what will you have, gaye? " "nothing at this hour. " "lew? "
      "scotch. " as garry mixed the drinks, he asked, "has ken got the
      springfield with him? " "no. We left it with themba. " "we could need it.
      " "yeah. We'll pick up ken, and then go straight to where we left themba.
      He's not only got the rifle, but extra water and most of the food. If we
      have to walk allnot only got the rifle, but extra water and most of the
      food. If we have to walk all the goddamn way, we could be at it for three
      or even four days. " garry saw gaye was examining the ring through the
      glass of the box. He joined her and peered over her shoulder. "take it out
      and wear it, " he said. "that box is awkward to carry and could get
      smashed. The ring will be a lot safer on your hand than in the box. " "if
      anyone's going to wear it, it'll be me, " fennel said, putting down his
      drink. "she's wearing it, " garry said quietly. "i trust her, but i can't
      say i trust you. " fennel glared at him, but garry's steady stare made him
      hesitate. Finally, he sat down with bad grace and picking up his glass, he
      drained it. Okay, you sonofabith, he thought. I'll fix you, when i fix
      her. Gaye took the ring out of the box. "the diamonds are lovely, but the
      ring isn't very beautiful, is it? " she tried the ring on the third finger
      of her right hand, but found it much too loose. "of course, i was
      forgetting . . . It's a man's ring. " she slid it on her thumb. "this is
      all right. It's a little awkward, but it won't come off. " garry looked at
      his watch. The time was 02.00 hrs. "go and lie down, gaye. I'm going to my
      room. We want all the rest we can get. We don't know when we'll get our
      next sleep. " he watched her go to her room, then he went to his, ignoring
      fennel. Fennel stretched out on the settee. He knew he wouldn't sleep. All
      his desire and frustration came back to him as he thought of gaye. If he
      had to follow her back to england, he told himself, he would get even with
      her. He had hoped to have found a chance of fixing her on the way back to
      mainville, but they would have to keep moving if they were to shake off
      the zulus. Fennel shifted uneasily. The thought of being hunted by a pack
      of zuluszulus. Fennel shifted uneasily. The thought of being hunted by a
      pack of zulus dried his mouth. A little before 04.00 hrs. , gaye was
      awakened by the sound of the beating of a drum. She sat up, swung her feet
      to the floor and listened. Not far away, she could hear the rhythmic sound
      of the drum like a pulse beat. She looked hastily at her watch and saw it
      was two minutes to the hour. She snatched up her rucksack and went into
      the lounge. Garry and fennel were standing by the terrace doors. A giant
      zulu came across the terrace and beckoned to them. He was a magnificent
      specimen of a man in his leopard skin and ostrich plumes. "here we go, "
      garry said and opened the terrace doors. The drum beat now was very loud.
      A row of some thirty zulus made a wall of glistening black bodies, covered
      with leopard skins. The ostrich plume head- dresses bobbed as they
      shuffled and stamped to the drum beat. They carried long narrow shields of
      buffalo hide and held in their left hands six throwing spears as they
      bent, straightened, shuffled and stamped. They made a frightening, awe-
      inspiring sight. The lone zulu made a savage gesture, jerking his assigai
      first at the three and then towards the distant jungle. The two men slung
      their rucksacks on their shoulders and with gaye between them, moved out
      on to the terrace. At the sight of them the dancing men uttered a loud,
      savage growl that set gaye's heart racing. The drum beat increased. They
      walked quickly across the lawn, looking ahead and not at the zulus. Gaye
      had to control herself not to run. They kept on, and in a few minutes,
      they were in the jungle. "nice looking lot, " garry said. "they are the
      boys who are coming after us. Where's ken? " fennel pointed. "see that
      balancing rock up there? That's where he is. " he cupped his hand to his
      mouth and bawled, "ken! Come on down, pronto! " then taking out his
      flashlight, he turned it on and began waving it. A light signalled back
      from the rock and they heard ken shout, "i'm coming. Keep your light on. "
      five minutes later, he joined them. "did you get it? I thought you were
      going to the airfield. " "we got it! " fennel said. "we've got to get to
      themba fast. The chopper's out. Come on, i'll tell you as we go. " ken
      peered at him. "trouble? " "i'll say . . . Get going! " ken started off
      with fennel, talking, by his side. Garry and gaye kept together. When ken
      understood the situation, he increased his pace. "you really think they're
      coming after us? " "damn sure of it. I won't worry so much once i've got
      the rifle, " fennel said. "if they look like overtaking us, we can ambush
      them, but without the rifle we're in dead trouble. " as they hurried along
      the jungle track, garry was thinking of the best way to evade the zulus.
      If they took the exit from the west which kahlenberg had said was
      relatively easy, it would develop into a race between them and the zulus
      who could move with the speed of a galloping horse. The east exit was out.
      None of them had any experience of mountain climbing whereas, according to
      kahlenberg, the zulus had. The north exit was too dangerous. Garry felt
      sure kahlenberg had been speaking the truth when he had said he had men
      already posted there. That left the south exit . . . Swamps and crocodiles
      and possibly the last exit the zulus would imagine they would try. Last
      exit the zulus would imagine they would try. In around forty minutes, they
      reached the open space where they had left themba. Twenty minutes less
      than it had taken ken and fennel to reach the balancing rock. They were
      all a little breathless and all jumpy. "it's that tree over there, " ken
      said pointing. "you sure? He's not there. " fennel stared across the open
      space in the dim light of the approaching dawn. "themba! " ken shouted.
      "themba! " the silence that greeted them sent a chill through them. Ken
      broke into a run. The others followed him. Reaching the tree, ken stopped.
      He knew it was the tree under which they had left themba. Not only did he
      recognize the stunted thorn bush he had noticed when he had left with
      fennel, but there was a heap of firewood piled by the tree. Under this
      tree had been their jerry can of water, the bag of food and the
      springfield rifle. There was no sign of any of these things. "the
      bastard's skipped with our stuff! " fennel snarled. "he wouldn't do that.
      Something's happened to him. " it was garry who spotted the grave away to
      his right. "what's that? " they looked at the mound of freshly turned
      earth and moving together, they approached it. So there should be no
      mistake as to what lay under the soil, placed on top of it was themba's
      australian bush hat. Ken was the first to realize what had happened. "they
      killed him, and they've taken the food, the water and the rifle, " he said
      huskily. For a long moment they all stood staring down at the grave. For a
      long moment they all stood staring down at the grave. Pulling himself
      together, garry said, "well, we now know what to expect. We've got to get
      moving. Look, ken, fennel's told you about the four exits. I'm opting to
      go south. They'll expect us to go by the west exit. With luck, by going
      south and through the swamps, they may not be able to track us. What do
      you think? " "it depends how bad the swamps are. They can be sheer hell,
      and that's crocodile country. " "all the same, i think it's our best bet.
      Have you a compass? " ken produced a small compass from his pocket. "i'm a
      qualified navigator, " garry went on. "do you want me to lead the way or
      will you do it? " "you do it. I've always relied on themba. " "then we go
      south. " garry steadied the compass and got a bearing. "let's go. " he
      started along a track with gaye at his heels. Fennel and ken followed
      behind. None of them said anything. Themba's death had shocked them all.
      The danger that was threatening them had been sharply brought home to
      them. They moved at a fast pace. The time was now 04.50 hrs. In a little
      more than two hours the zulus would be after them. They had been walking
      for some twenty minutes when garry stopped and checked the compass. "this
      track's beginning to curve to the west, " he said as the other two came
      up. "we'll have to leave it and cut through the jungle. " they looked at
      the high tangled grass and the thorny shrubs and the trees. "that's going
      to slow us up like hell, " fennel complained. "can't be helped. We've got
      to go south and that's the way to the south. " "i don't want to scare you,
      " ken said quietly, "but this is snake country. Keep your eyes skinned.
      "your eyes skinned. " gaye clutched hold of garry's arm. "don't worry, "
      he said, forcing a grin. "i'll look after you. Let's go. " they began to
      toil through the thick matted grass, zig zagging around the trees, aware
      of the chattering monkeys overhead. Garry kept checking the compass. While
      kahlenberg had been talking, garry had been studying the wall map. He had
      realized that the river could be their salvation for he remembered as he
      flew over the estate, seeing the river in the distance and also seeing a
      small town to the south of it. The river was now vitally important to them
      as they had no water with them. But he was also aware that since entering
      the jungle, their pace had slackened and he felt pretty sure the zulus
      would have much less difficulty in covering this kind of ground than they
      were having. After some three kilometres, they came out on to another
      jungle track which headed due south. "how are you making out? " garry
      asked, as he quickened his pace, catching hold of gaye's hand and pulling
      her along with him. "i'm all right, but i wish we knew how far we have to
      go. " "i don't think it's too far . . . Around twenty kilometres before we
      get off the estate. I studied that wall map. This is the nearest exit to
      kahlenberg's boundary. " plodding along behind, fennel was being
      handicapped by the weight of his tool bag. "i'll carry it for a bit, " ken
      said, seeing fennel was tiring. Fennel stopped and regarded the bag
      angrily. "no, you won't! I've had enough of this bloody thing. We'll never
      get anywhere if we go on carrying it. So okay, it cost me money, but if we
      get out of here i can buy a new kit. If we don't get out, then i won't
      need one. To hell with it. " he heaved the tool bag far into the jungle.
      "i would have carried it, " ken said. "i would have carried it, " ken
      said. Fennel grinned crookedly at him. "i know and thanks. I'm glad to be
      rid of it. " they stepped out and soon caught up with the other two. Then
      suddenly the track petered out into a large puddle of oozing mud. "this is
      where the swamp starts, " ken said. "with the rain we've had, it could be
      bad. " they left the track and moved into the jungle. The ground felt soft
      under their feet, but they pushed on. Later, the ground began to squelch
      under their weight and the going became harder. By now the sun was up and
      they could feel the steamy heat. Garry kept checking the compass. When the
      ground got too sodden, they had to find a way around it and then get back
      on the compass bearing. The smell of rotting humus, the steamy heat that
      steadily increased as the sun climbed above the trees, the slippery boggy
      ground made progress slow and unpleasant. They kept moving, their eyes
      searching the ground for snakes. Ken said suddenly, "they're on their way.
      " garry looked at his watch. The time was exactly 07.00 hrs. They all
      increased their pace with a feeling of slight panic, but the increase
      didn't last long: the going was too hard. Ken said suddenly, "i can smell
      water. The river's not far off. " ten minutes later, they came out of the
      shade of the trees to a broad, slippery bank leading down to a brownish
      stream, not more than twenty metres wide. "that's our direction if we can
      get across, " garry said. "think it's deep? " "could be. " ken joined him
      and surveyed the water. "it's no distance . . . Just the curse of getting
      wet in that foul water. I'll see. " he took off his shoes and shirt,
      padded across the oozing mud and grabbing hold of a branch of a tree, he
      lowered himself into the stagnant water while he groped to find bottom
      with his foot. Foot. "it's deep. We'll have to swim. " he let himself go,
      then started across the stream to the other side of the bank with a
      strong, overarm stroke. It happened so quickly none of the other three
      watching him believed what they were seeing. There was a sudden rush from
      the thick jungle grass on the opposite bank. Something that looked like a
      green and brown tree trunk flashed into the water near ken. An evil
      looking scaly snout revealed itself for a brief moment. Ken screamed and
      threw up his arms. Then he and the crocodile vanished under the water
      which became agitated and rapidly turned into a foaming vortex of stinking
      brown water, horribly tinged with red. Chapter nine at midday it rained.
      For the past two hours, swollen, black clouds had slowly built up,
      darkening the sky and blotting out the burning sun. The heat, by the
      placidly flowing stream, had become more and more oppressive. Then
      abruptly the rain came as if the sky had opened, releasing a deluge of
      warm water that soaked the three to the skin in seconds. So heavy was the
      rain, they were blinded by the water smashing down on them and were
      enveloped in steaming mist. Catching hold of gaye's hand, garry ran into
      the jungle and paused under the cover of a vast baobab tree, its thick
      foliage offering a leaky shelter. Cursing and muttering, fennel joined
      them. They squatted down, their backs against the tree and stared at the
      now raging river in silence. None of them had spoken for four hours. The
      shock of ken's horrible end had reduced them to a numbed silence. Although
      they hadn't known him for long, they had all liked him for there had been
      nothing to dislike about him. What shocked them more than anything was the
      swiftness and the way of his going. Gaye was sure that the terrible scene
      was now indelibly printed on her mind. Ken's terrified expression, his
      wild scream as the crocodile's teeth had crunched down on his leg and the
      brief sight of the evil, scaly snout were the ingredients of future
      nightmares. Garry too had been violently shocked, but he was mentally much
      more resilient than either gaye or fennel. When he had seen ken disappear
      and had seen the blood on the foaming water, he knew there was nothing he
      could do to help him. His duty to the others and himself was to keep
      moving, for he knew they dare not waste a moment, ever aware of
      kahlenberg's threat that if caught, they would be impaled, and he had
      enough imagination to know such a death would be far more horrible than
      ken's death. So catching hold of gaye's hand, ignoring her hysterical
      sobbing, he dragged her away from the scene and back into the jungle. He
      kept moving until finally she steadied herself, stopped sobbing and
      continued with him, walking like a zombie. Perhaps of the three of them,
      fennel was the most affected. He had come to admire ken. The episode with
      the land rover on the narrow track had enormously impressed him. He knew
      he hadn't the guts to have done such a thing. Ken's coolness when he was
      dangling at the end of the cable hadthing. Ken's coolness when he was
      dangling at the end of the cable had completely wiped out fennel's
      hostility. Ken's death now left him viciously angry, and in a brooding,
      homicidal state of mind. Why hadn't this sonofabitch edwards gone into the
      stream first? He and his whore weren't worth a tenth of what ken had been
      worth. He looked at them out of the corners of his small glittering eyes.
      Garry had his arm around gaye and fennel felt a hot, furious rush of blood
      to his head. Well, i'll fix them, he thought. No one shoves me around as
      that bitch did without paying for it. Garry was speaking quietly to gaye.
      "this rain's lucky. It'll wash out our tracks. This was the one thing i
      was praying for. They can't track us after this storm. " gaye clutched his
      hand. She was still too shocked to speak. After some ten minutes, the rain
      began to slacken. "we must get on, " garry said, getting to his feet.
      We've got to cross the river. " he turned to fennel. "think we could build
      a raft? " "i've thrown my goddamn tool kit away, " fennel told him, "how
      the hell can we build a raft without tools? " garry walked to the edge of
      the river. The opposite bank was thick with high grass and shrubs. Were
      more crocodiles lurking on the bank, hidden from sight, waiting for them?
      After what had happened to ken, he decided the risk was too great to
      attempt a crossing. He decided to push on down the river in the hope that
      they would come to a clearing where crocodiles couldn't conceal
      themselves. "before we go further, let's eat, " he said, and opening ken's
      rucksack, he produced a can of stewed beef. "we'll split this between the
      three of us. " "i'm not hungry . . . I don't want any, " gaye said
      listlessly. "you've got to eat! " garry said sharply. Now, come on. " "no
      . . . Leave me alone. ""no . . . Leave me alone. " garry looked closely at
      her. Her white drawn face, her eyes that had become sunken, began to worry
      him. "are you all right? " "i have a headache. The thought of food makes
      me feel ill . . . Just leave me alone. " was it shock? He asked himself.
      Or was she ill? He flinched at the thought. To fall sick now would be a
      disaster. The meal finished, the two men got to their feet. Garry went
      over to gaye and touched her lightly on her shoulder. She opened her eyes,
      and again he felt a pang of alarm at the heavy, dull look in her eyes. She
      dragged herself to her feet. "you're not ill, gaye? " he asked. "no. "
      "come on! " fennel barked. "i want to get going if you don't! " garry
      walked by gaye's side. She moved listlessly and had lost the spring in her
      step. He took her arm. "don't fuss! " she tried to pull away. "i'm all
      right. It's just this awful headache. " he kept hold of her and walked on,
      but they weren't making the speed they had made earlier on. "keep moving
      for god's sake! " fennel barked suddenly. "what the hell are you two
      loitering for? " gaye made an effort and quickened her pace. They kept on,
      but after a couple of kilometres, she again began to lag and garry found
      he had to force her on. He was seriously worried now. She seemed to be
      walking in her sleep, dragging one foot after the other. "you're feeling
      rotten, aren't you? " he said at last. "what is it? " "my head feels as if
      it is going to burst . . . I suppose it's the sun. " "let's rest for a
      moment. " "no . . . I'll manage. Just don't fuss. " another three
      kilometres brought them to a place garry was hoping to find. The jungle
      fell away, either side of the river mud flats with no cover spread out
      before them. "this is where we cross, " garry said. He eyed the swift
      moving river. "do you think you can manage, gaye? " "yes, if you keep near
      me. " fennel came to the edge of the bank and surveyed the water
      suspiciously. "are you going first? " he asked garry. "don't get excited .
      . . It's safe enough and it's not far across, " garry said curtly. He led
      gaye to some shade. "sit down. I want to find a branch of a tree to get
      our stuff over dry. " she sank down as garry went off into the jungle.
      Fennel eyed her, thinking all the glamour had gone out of her now. "what
      the hell's the matter with you? " he demanded, standing over her. She put
      her head in her hands. "leave me alone. " "are you sick? " "i have a
      headache . . . Leave me alone. ""i have a headache . . . Leave me alone. "
      the sunlight reflected on the diamonds of the borgia ring, making them
      sparkle. Fennel eyed the ring. "you better give me the ring to carry. I
      don't want it lost. Come on, give it to me! " "no! " garry came out of the
      jungle dragging a long branch covered with foliage behind him. Muttering
      under his breath, fennel moved away from gaye. It took garry very few
      minutes to tie the rucksacks and their shoes to the branch. "let's go, "
      he said to gaye. "hang on to the branch. I'll push it over. " uneasily,
      fennel watched them enter the water. He looked up and down the opposite
      bank, expecting to see a crocodile appear, but saw nothing. They were
      across in a few minutes, and his eyes narrowed when he saw gaye had
      collapsed on the mud bank and lay face down. He entered the water and swam
      fast and in panic to the other side. Garry had turned gaye and was
      kneeling over her, looking anxiously down at her white face. She seemed
      unconscious. Water streaming from him, fennel came up. "what's the matter?
      " he demanded roughly. "she's ill. " garry picked up the unconscious girl
      and carried her across the mud flat into the shade of a tree. He laid her
      down on a carpet of rotting leaves. "get the rucksacks and the shoes, " he
      went on. Fennel did as he was told, put on his shoes and came back to
      where garry was anxiously watching gaye. "i guess she's picked up some
      bug, " fennel said indifferently. "well come on, edwards, let's go. Those
      black bastards may be right behind us. " "look around and see if you can
      find two straight branches. We could make a stretcher with our shirts. "
      fennel stared at him. "you out of your head? Do you imagine i'm going to
      help carry that bitch through this goddamn jungle and in this heat when
      those blacks are racing after us? You carry her if you want to, but i'm
      not. " garry looked up at him, his face hardening. "are you saying we
      should leave her here? " "why not? What's she to us? You're wasting time.
      Leave her and get going. " garry stood up. "you go. I'm staying with her.
      Go on . . . Get out! " fennel licked his lips as he stared at garry. "i
      want the compass and the ring, " he said softly. "you get neither! Get
      out! " for a man of his bulk, fennel could move very quickly. His fist
      flashed out as he jumped forward, but garry was expecting just this move.
      He ducked under the fist and hooked fennel to the jaw: a crushing punch
      that flattened fennel. "i said get out! " garry snapped. Fennel had landed
      on his back, his arms flung wide. His groping fingers closed on a rock,
      half-hidden in the grass. He gripped it and with a violent movement,
      hurled it at garry. The rock smashed against the side of garry's head and
      he went down as if he had been pole-axed. His jaw throbbing, fennel
      struggled to his feet. He approached garry cautiouslyhis jaw throbbing,
      fennel struggled to his feet. He approached garry cautiously and bent over
      him. Satisfied that garry was unconscious, fennel slipped his fingers into
      garry's shirt pocket and found the compass. He crossed over to where gaye
      was lying. Catching hold of her right wrist, he pulled the borgia ring off
      her thumb. As he did so, she opened her eyes and seeing his face close to
      hers, she struck at him with her left hand. It was such a feeble blow
      fennel scarcely felt it. He grinned viciously. "good-bye, baby, " he said,
      bending over her. "i hope you suffer. I'm taking the compass and the ring.
      You two will never get out of here alive. If you had been nice to me, i
      would have been nice to you. You asked for it and you're getting it. " he
      stood up. "if the zulus don't find you, the vultures will. So long, and
      have a wonderful time while it lasts. " gaye closed her eyes. He doubted
      if she had understood half what he had said, but it gave him a lot of
      satisfaction to have said it. He picked up the rucksack containing the
      last of the food and the water bottle, checked the compass for his
      bearing, then set off fast into the dark steamy heat of the jungle. Garry
      stirred and opened his eyes. A shadow passed over his face, then another.
      He looked up at the tree. He could see through the foliage, heavy grey
      clouds moving sluggishly westward. Then he saw two vultures settling
      heavily on the topmost branch of the tree, bearing it down under their
      combined weight. Their bald, obscene looking heads, the cruel, hooked
      beaks and their hunched shoulders sent a chill of fear through him. His
      head throbbed and when he touched the side of his face, he felt encrusted
      blood. He was still dazed, but after resting a few minutes, his mind began
      to clear. His hand went to his shirt pocket and he found the compass gone.
      He struggled to his feet and went unsteadily over to where gaye was lying.
      She now looked flushed and her forehead was covered with beads of sweat.
      She seemed to be either sleeping or unconscious. He looked at her right
      hand. It was no surprise to see the ring was missing. He squatted down
      beside her and considered his position. He had possibly fifteen kilometres
      of jungle swamp ahead of him before he reached the boundary exit. He
      glanced towards the rucksacks and saw the rucksack containing the food was
      also missing. Without food or water, he couldn't hope to last long. His
      watch told him it was i6.00 hrs. The zulus had been searching for them now
      for ninetold him it was i6.00 hrs. The zulus had been searching for them
      now for nine hours. Had the rain washed out their tracks? If it hadn't, he
      could expect the zulus to appear any time now. Had he been alone, he would
      have gone off at once in the hope of overtaking fennel, but he couldn't
      leave gaye. He looked down at her. Maybe fennel had been right about her
      picking up a bug. She looked very ill and was obviously running a high
      temperature. As he watched her she slowly opened her eyes. It took her a
      few moments to get him into focus, then she frowned, moving as if in pain.
      "you're hurt, " she said huskily. "it's all right. " he took her hot hand
      in his. "don't worry about that. " "he's taken the compass and the ring. "
      "i know. Take it easy. Don't worry about anything. " the sudden crashing
      of branches overhead startled them and both looked up. One of the vultures
      had dropped from the upper branch to a lower one and was stretching its
      mangy neck, peering down at them. Getting to his feet, garry picked up the
      bloodstained rock and heaved it up into the tree. The rock whistled by the
      vulture. It flew off with a great flapping of wings and rustling of
      leaves. "it knows i am dying, " gaye said, her voice breaking. "garry! I'm
      so frightened. " "you're not dying! You've caught a bug of some sort. In a
      day or so, you'll be fine. " she looked at him, and his heart sank at the
      fear and hopelessness he saw in her eyes. "there's nothing you can do for
      me, " she said. "leave me. You must think of yourself, garry. It won't be
      long for me. I don't know what it is, but it's as if something is creeping
      up inside me, killing me piecemeal. My feet are so cold, yet the rest of
      me burns. " garry felt her naked feet. They were ice cold. "of course i'm
      not leaving you. Are you thirsty? " "no. I have no feeling in my throat. "
      she closed her eyes, shivering. "you must go, garry. If they caught you .
      . . " it dawned on him then that she could be dying. With her by his side,
      the attempt to get through the jungle wouldn't have daunted him, but
      realizing he might have to do it alone sent a prickle of panic through
      him. "do you believe in god? " she asked. "sometimes. " he hesitated. "for
      both of us this is really the time to believe, isn't it? " "you're going
      to be all right. " "isn't it? " "i guess so. " there was a sudden
      disturbance in the tree above them as the vultures settled again. She
      caught hold of his hand. "you really mean you are going to stay with me? "
      "yes, darling. I'm staying. " "thank you, garry, you're sweet. I won't
      keep you long. " she looked up at the vultures who were looking down at
      her. "promise me something. " "anything. " "you won't be able to bury me.
      You can't dig with your bare hands, darling, can you? Put me in the river,
      please. I don't mind the crocodiles, but the vultures . . . " "it's not
      coming to that. You rest now. By tomorrow, you'll be fine. " "promise,
      garry. ""promise, garry. " "all right, i promise, but . . . " she
      interrupted him. "you were right when you told me not to pin everything on
      money. If money hadn't meant so much to me i wouldn't be here now. Garry,
      have you a piece of paper and a pen? I want to make my will. " "now, look,
      gaye, you've got to stop being morbid. " she began to cry helplessly.
      "garry . . . Please . . . You don't know what an effort it is even to
      talk. I hurt so inside. Please let me make my will. " he went to his
      rucksack and found a notebook and a biro. "i must do it myself, " she
      said. "the manager of the swiss bank knows my handwriting. Prop me up,
      garry. " as he raised her and supported her, she caught her breath in a
      sobbing moan of pain. It took her a long time to write the letter, but
      finally it was done. "everything i have, garry darling, is for you.
      There's over $100,000 in securities in my numbered account in bern. Go and
      see dr. Kirst. He's the director there. Tell him what has happened . . .
      Tell him everything and especially tell him about kahlenberg's museum.
      He'll know what to do and keep you clear. Give him this will and he will
      arrange everything for you. " "all right . . . You're going to be all
      right, gaye. Rest now, " and garry kissed her. Three hours later, as the
      sun, a red burning ball in the sky, sank behind the trees, gaye drifted
      out of life into death. With the deadly scratch she hadn't noticed, the
      borgia ring claimed yet another victim. Fennel had been walking fast now
      for the past two hours. From time to time, swamp land had made him take a
      wide detour, wasting time and energy. Once he had floundered up to his
      knees in stinking wet mud when the ground had givenhad floundered up to
      his knees in stinking wet mud when the ground had given under his feet. He
      had had a desperate struggle to extricate himself: a struggle that left
      him exhausted. The silence in the jungle, the loneliness and the heat all
      bothered him but he kept reassuring himself that he couldn't now be far
      from the boundary exit and then his troubles would be over. He kept
      thinking of the triumphant moment when he would walk into shalik's office
      and tell him he had the ring. If shalik imagined he was going to get the
      ring for nine thousand dollars, he was in for a surprise. Fennel had
      already made up his mind he wouldn't part with the ring unless shalik paid
      him the full amount the other three and he would have shared . . .
      Thirty-six thousand dollars. With any luck, in another four or five days,
      he would be back in london. He would collect the money and leave
      immediately for nice. He was due a damn good vacation after this caper, he
      told himself. When he was tired of nice, he would hire a yacht, find some
      bird and do a cruise along the med. , stopping in at the harbours along
      the coast for a meal and a look around: an ideal vacation and safe from
      moroni. He had now dismissed gaye and garry from his mind, never doubting
      he had seen the last of them. The stupid, stuck-up bitch had asked for
      trouble. No bird ever turned him down without regretting it. He wished ken
      were with him. He frowned as he thought of the way ken had died. With ken,
      he would have felt much more sure of himself. Now, the sun was going down
      and the jungle was getting unpleasantly dark. He decided it was time to
      stop for the night. He hurried forward, looking for a clearing where he
      could get off the narrow track. After some searching, he found what he was
      looking for: a patch of coarse grass, clear of shrubs with a tree under
      which he could shelter if it rained. He put down his rucksack and paused
      to wonder if he dare light a fire. He decided the risk was negligible and
      set about gathering sticks and kindling. When he had collected a large
      heap by the tree, he got the fire going, then sat down, his back resting
      against the tree. He was hungry and he opened the rucksack and took stock.
      There were three cans of stewed steak, two cans of beans and a can of
      steak pie. Nodding his satisfaction, he opened the can of steak pie. When
      he had finished the meal, he lit a cigarette, threw more sticks on the
      fire and relaxed. Now he was sitting still, he became aware of the noises
      in the jungle: soft, disturbing and distracting sounds: leaves rustled,
      some animal growled faintly in the distance: fennel wondered if it were a
      leopard. In the trees he could hear a sudden chatter of hidden monkeys
      start up and immediately cease. Some bigsudden chatter of hidden monkeys
      start up and immediately cease. Some big birds flapped overhead. He
      finished his cigarette, added more still 4 to the fire and stretched out.
      The dampness had penetrated his clothes and he wondered if he would sleep.
      He closed his eyes. Immediately, the distracting sounds of the jungle
      became amplified and alarming. He sat up, his eyes searching beyond the
      light of the fire into the outer darkness. Suppose the zulus had spotted
      the fire and were creeping up on him? He thought. They hammer a skewer
      into your lower intestine, kahlenberg had said. Fennel felt cold sweat
      break out on his face. He had been crazy to have lit the fire. It could be
      spotted from a long distance away by the sharp-eyed savages. He grabbed up
      a big stick and scattered the fire. Then getting to his feet, he stamped
      out the burning embers until the sparks had died in the wet grass. Then it
      was even worse because the darkness descended on him like a hot,
      smothering, black cloak. He groped for the tree, sat down, resting his
      back against it and peered fearfully forward, but now it was as if he were
      blind. He could see nothing. He remained like that for more than an hour,
      listening and starting with every sound. But finally he began to nod to
      sleep. He was suddenly too exhausted to care. How long he slept, he didn't
      know, but he woke with a start, his heart racing. He was sure he was no
      longer alone. His built-in instinct for danger had sounded an emergency
      alarm in his mind. He groped in the darkness and found the thick stick
      with which he had scattered the fire. He gripped it while he listened.
      Quite close . . . Not more than five metres from him, there was a distinct
      sound of something moving through the carpet of leaves. He had his
      flashlight by him and picking it up, his racing heart half suffocating
      him, he pointed the torch in the direction of the sound, then pressed the
      button. The powerful beam lit up a big crouching animal that fennel
      recognized by its fox-like head and its filthy fawn and black spotted fur
      to be a fully grown dog hyena. He had only a brief glimpse of the animal
      before it disappeared into the thicket on the far side of the track, but
      that glimpse was enough to bring fennel to hison the far side of the
      track, but that glimpse was enough to bring fennel to his feet, panic
      stricken. He remembered a conversation he had had with ken while they were
      in the land rover on the first easy leg of the journey to kahlenberg's
      estate. "i get along with all the animals out here except the hyena, " ken
      had said. "he is a filthy brute. Not many people know this scavenger has
      the most powerful teeth and jaws of any animal. He can crack the thigh of
      a domestic cow the way you crack a nut. Besides being dangerous, he is an
      abject coward. He seldom moves except by night, and he will go miles
      following a scent and has infinite patience to wait to catch his prey
      unawares. " with his eyes bolting out of his head, his hand shaking,
      fennel played the beam of the flashlight into the thicket. For a brief
      moment he saw the animal glaring at him, then vanish. He has infinite
      patience to wait to catch his prey unawares. Fennel knew there was no
      further sleep for him that night, and he looked at his wristwatch. The
      time was 03.00 hrs. Another hour before it began to get light and he could
      move. Not daring to waste the battery, he turned off the flashlight.
      Sitting down, he leaned against the tree and listened. From out of the
      darkness came a horrifying, maniacal laugh that chilled his blood and
      raised the hairs on the nape of his neck. The horrible, indescribably
      frightening sound was repeated . . . The howl of a starving hyena. Fennel
      longed for ken's company. He even longed for garry's company. Sitting in
      total darkness, knowing the stinking beast might be creeping slowly on its
      mangy belly, his powerful jaws slavering, towards him, he remained
      motionless, tense and straining to hear the slightest sound. He remained
      like that, his body aching for sleep, his mind feverish with panic for the
      next hour. Whenever he dozed off, the howl of the hyena brought him awake
      and cursing. If only he had the springfield or even an assigai, he
      thought, but he had nothing with which to defend himself except the thick
      stick which he was sure would be useless if the beast sprang at him. When
      dawn finally came, fennel was almost a wreck. His legs were stiff and his
      muscles ached. His body cried out for rest. He dragged himself upright,
      picked up his rucksack, and after assuring himself there was no sign of
      the hyena, he set off along the jungle track, again heading south.
      Although he forced himself along, his speed had slowed and he wasn't
      covering the ground as he had thealong, his speed had slowed and he wasn't
      covering the ground as he had the previous day. He wished he knew how much
      further he had to go before he reached the boundary exit. The jungle was
      as dense as it had been yesterday and showed no sign of clearing. He
      walked for two hours, then decided to rest and eat. Sitting on a fallen
      tree, he opened a can of beans and ate them slowly, then he took a small
      drink from the water bottle. He smoked a cigarette, reluctant to move, but
      he knew he was dangerously wasting time. With an effort he got to his feet
      and set off again. Having walked for some five kilometres, he paused to
      check the compass. From the reading, he realized with dismay that he was
      now walking south-west instead of due south. The track had been curving
      slightly, taking him away from his direction and he hadn't noticed it.
      Cursing, he fixed his bearing and saw that to move in the right direction,
      he would have to leave the path and force his way through the thick, evil
      smelling undergrowth. He hesitated, remembering what ken had said about
      snakes. It would be a hell of a thing, he thought, to have got this far
      and then to get bitten by a snake. Gripping his stick, he moved into the
      long, matted grass, feeling the sharp blades of the grass scratching at
      his bare legs. The sun was coming up, and already the heat was oppressive.
      The . Going was deadly slow now, , and sweat began to stream off him as he
      slashed his way through the grass and tangled undergrowth with his stick,
      cursing aloud. Ahead of him, after a kilometre of exhausting struggle, he
      saw a wide open plain and he gasped with relief. He broke through to it,
      but almost immediately, his feet sank up to his ankles in wet, clinging
      mud and he backed away, returning to the undergrowth. The plain he had
      imagined would be so easy to cross was nothing more than a dangerous
      swamp. He was now forced to go around the swamp, making an exhausting
      detour, feeling his strength slowly ebbing from him as he struggled on in
      the breathless heat. He now began to wonder if he would ever get out of
      this hellish place. He would have to rest again, he told himself. That was
      the trouble. He was worn out after a sleepless night. Maybe if he could
      sleep for three or four hours, he would get back his strength which he had
      always taken for granted and relied on. It was a risk, he thought, but a
      risk that had to be taken if he was to conserve his strength for the last
      lap through the swamp. He remembered ken had said hyenas only hunted at
      night. The beast was probably miles away by now. He would have to find
      somewhere to hide before he dare have the sleep his body was aching for.
      He dragged himself on until he saw a big, fallen tree some way from the
      track and surrounded by shrubs. This seemed as good a place as any, and
      when he reached it he found the ground on the far side of the trunk
      reasonably dry. Thankfully, he lay down. He made a pillow of his rucksack,
      placed the rucksack of food near at hand and the thick stick by his side.
      He lowered his head on the rucksack, stretched out and in a few moments,
      he was asleep. He hadn't been sleeping for more than a few minutes when
      out of the jungle came the hyena. It sniffed the ground, paused, then
      cocked its head on one side as it eyed the fallen tree. Making a silent,
      wide detour, it slunk around to the other side of the tree where fennel
      was sleeping. The hyena hadn't eaten for two days and it was half mad with
      hunger, but although there was a meal before it for the taking, it was too
      cowardly as yet to attack. It sank down, its muzzle resting on its paws
      and stared with gleaming red eyes at the sleeping man. Unhappily for
      fennel, he was so exhausted, he slept the sleep of the dead, neither
      making a sound nor moving. After half an hour of watching the hyena
      finally convinced itself that there was no danger for a hit and run
      attack. It hunched its hind legs, lifted itself and struck. Fennel was
      awakened by such intense pain that he was screaming out as he opened his
      eyes. He half started up, but the pain raging in his legs absorbed all his
      strength and he fell back, his fists pounding the sides of his head as the
      rising pain drove him frantic. Looking down, he was horrified to see that
      where his right calf had been there was now only a mess of blood and
      splintered bone. He could even see the white of his shin bone where the
      fleshy part of his calf had been ripped away. Sobbing and moaning, he
      looked frantically around and he saw the hyena some ten metres from him,
      its muzzle bloodstained as it chewed the lump of flesh. Blood was pouring
      from the terrible wound and fennel realized if someone didn't come to his
      help at once, he would be dead in a few minutes. Already faintness was
      gripping him. Gathering his remaining strength, he yelled, "help! " at the
      top of his voice. The shout echoed through the jungle. Startled, the hyena
      dashed into the undergrowth and released its horrible laughing howl.
      Fennel tried to shout again, but only succeeded in making a croaking sound
      that carried no distance. The agony raving through his body brought
      unconsciousnesscarried no distance. The agony raving through his body
      brought unconsciousness near. The blood pouring from his wound attracted a
      swarm of flies which were now excitedly buzzing around the fast growing
      pool of blood. Fennel was now too weak to do anything but lie flat,
      shuddering and moaning with pain. He could see outlined against the grey
      clouds, a number of vultures circling overhead. He watched them drop into
      a nearby tree one by one and peer down at him speculatively. He didn't see
      the hyena creeping on its belly towards him. He was only aware of it when
      he felt a sudden rush, smelt decay as the beast pounced on him, then a
      blinding pain as the sharp, powerful jaws and teeth bit through the top of
      his shorts and disembowelled him. Ngomane, a magnificently built zulu, had
      once worked on the kahlenberg estate, but there had been woman trouble and
      he had been dismissed. Before his dismissal, ngomane had been one of the
      forty guards patrolling the jungle on the look-out for unwelcomed visitors
      and poachers. He knew the jungle as he knew the back of his hand and after
      his dismissal, he pondered how he could earn a living. He decided that as
      there were many crocodiles on kahlenberg's estate and as he knew where to
      find them and as the other guards were sympathetic about his dismissal, it
      would be safe and profitable, from time to time, to kill a few of the
      reptiles and sell their skins to the white storekeeper in mainville who
      never asked questions and paid well. Ngomane was trotting silently along
      the jungle track, having just entered from the south boundary and was
      heading for the river, when he heard fennel's frantic cry for help. He
      stopped abruptly, fingering his ancient rifle, looking uneasily in the
      direction of the sound. Then curiosity getting the better of caution, he
      moved into the jungle and in a few moments he had found what was left of
      fennel. Garry walked slowly along the river bank, keeping in the shade
      where possible, his eyes searching the ground before him for snakes and
      signs of hidden crocodiles. He had decided that without a compass it would
      be inviting disaster to attempt to reach the boundary exit through the
      jungle. He remembered that the relief map in kahlenberg's office had shown
      that after the river had passed the boundary of the estate, it continued
      on for some twenty kilometres to pass through a small town. Although he
      would be faced with a walk at least twice as long as the direct south
      route through the jungle, he knew if he could keep going, he could not
      lose his way and with any luck would not encounter swamp land and be
      forced to makeway and with any luck would not encounter swamp land and be
      forced to make exhausting detours. On the other hand he exposed himself to
      attack from crocodiles and he could be more easily spotted if the zulus
      had got this far up the river. But weighing the pros and cons, he finally
      opted for the river route. He was feeling depressed and weary. He had
      committed gaye's body to the river and had watched it float away into the
      darkness. He had hated the task, but he had no tool to dig a grave. Having
      seen her on her way, he had gone into the jungle and laid down. He had
      slept badly, dreaming of her and had started his walk soon after 05.00
      hrs. He had been walking now for four hours, not moving quickly, but
      steadily, carefully pacing himself to conserve his strength. He was hungry
      and thirsty. From time to time, he moistened his lips with the foul river
      water, but refrained from drinking it. He had four packs of cigarettes in
      his rucksack, and by continually smoking, he took the edge off his hunger
      and kept the mosquitoes at bay. As he walked, he wondered how far fennel
      had got by now. By the time he himself reached mainville if he ever
      reached it fennel would be on his way to johannesburg. Garry was sure
      fennel would immediately fly to london, hand over the ring, collect his
      share and then disappear. Garry wondered if shalik would pay him his share
      once shalik had the ring: he probably wouldn't. It didn't matter, garry
      told himself. Thanks to gaye, he was now worth $100,000. With such sum, he
      could take the course in electronics and then buy himself a partnership.
      But first he had to get back to england. He rested at midday for an hour
      and then continued on. By dusk, he had covered twenty-five kilometres. By
      keeping to the river, the walk, except for the gnawing pangs of hunger and
      a raging thirst, had been far less arduous than if he had taken to the
      jungle, but he knew he had at least another thirty kilometres to face the
      following morning and he, like fennel, began to wonder if he would make
      it. He moved into the jungle when it became too dark to see where he was
      going and laid down under a tree and slept. He woke soon after 05.00 hrs.
      As the sun was beginning to rise. Going down to the edge of the river, he
      scooped the brown dirty water over his face and head and moistened his
      lips without swallowing. The temptation was great, but he resisted it,
      sure that the water could contain a host of deadly bacteria. He started
      off, keeping his pace steady, heading for an elbow bend in the river, and
      wondering what he would find around the corner. With luck, he told
      himself, he could be at the exit of the estate. It took him an hour to
      reach the bend and to get a clear view of the river which was now wide and
      straight. As he paused to examine both banks of the river, he suddenly
      stiffened. Could that be a boat pulled up on the mud flat some sixty
      metres ahead of him or was it a fallen tree? He started forward, peering
      into the half light, and in a few minutes, he decided that it was a flat
      bottom canoe. His hunger and thirst forgotten, his heart pounding, he
      broke into a stumbling run. He reached the canoe and then stopped
      abruptly. Lying in the bottom of the canoe was a dead zulu. By his side
      were two rucksacks which garry recognized as belonging to ken and fennel
      and more welcome still, ken's water bottle. On the zulu's forefinger of
      his right hand, flashing in the sunlight, was the caesar borgia ring. As
      soon as garry had cleared the customs at london airport, he hurried to a
      telephone box and dialled toni's number. The time was 10.25 hrs. And he
      was pretty sure she would be still sleeping. After the bell had rung for
      some minutes, he heard a click, then a sleepy voice said, "miss white is
      away. " knowing she was about to hang up, garry shouted, "toni! It's me! "
      there was a pause, then toni, now very much awake, released a squeal of
      excitement. "garry! Is that really you, darling? " "yes. I've just got in
      from jo'burg. " "and you're calling me? Oh, darling! So she isn't so
      marvellous after all? " "don't let's talk about her. " garry's voice went
      down a note. "listen, toni, how are you fixed? I'm flying to bern tomorrow
      morning and i want you to come with me. " "bern? Where's bern? ""it's in
      switzerland. Didn't you learn anything at school? " "i learned to make
      love. Who cares where bern is anyway? You want me to come with you? Why,
      darling, of course! I'd go with you to vierwaldstattersee if you wanted me
      to. " "that's nice. Where's that? " she giggled. "it's in switzerland too.
      How long will we be staying? " "a day or so, then i thought we would go
      down to capri for two weeks and really live it up. You know where capri
      is, don't you? " "yes, of course. I'd love to, garry, but i simply can't.
      I have to work. I can manage three days, but not two weeks. " "wives
      shouldn't work, toni. " there was silence. He could hear her breathing
      over the line and he imagined her kneeling on the bed in her shortie
      nightdress, her big blue eyes very round and astonished, and he grinned.
      "did you say wives shouldn't work? " she asked, her voice husky. "that's
      what the man said. " "but i'm not married, garry. " "you soon will be. See
      you in two hours from now, " and he hurriedly hung up. He piled his
      luggage into a taxi and told the driver to take him to the royal towers
      hotel. Arriving at the hotel, he had his luggage put in the baggage room
      and then asked the hall porter to call shalik's suite and announce him.
      The hall porter to call shalik's suite and announce him. There was a brief
      delay, then the hall porter told him to go up. Arriving at the suite, he
      tapped and entered the outer room. A blonde girl sat at the desk, busily
      typing. She surveyed him as she paused in her work and got to her feet.
      Dressed in black, she was tall and willowy and exactly the type of girl
      garry went out of his way to avoid: hard, shrewd, intelligent and very
      efficient. "mr. Edwards? " "correct. " "mr. Shalik will see you now. " she
      opened the door to shalik's office and motioned him forward as if she were
      shooing in a nervous chicken. Garry smiled at her more from force of habit
      than to be friendly. He need not have bothered. She wasn't looking at him
      and her indifference irritated him. He found shalik sitting at his desk,
      smoking a cigar, his plump hands resting on the blotter. As garry walked
      towards him, he said, "good morning, mr. Edwards. Have you the ring? "
      "yes, i have it. " garry sat down in the lounging chair opposite shalik.
      He crossed his long legs and regarded shalik. "you have? My
      congratulations. I take it the other three will be coming to join us in a
      moment or so? " garry shook his head. "no, they won't be coming to join
      us. " shalik frowned. Shalik frowned. "but surely they want their fee?
      "they won't be coming and they won't be collecting their fee. " shalik sat
      back, studied the end of his cigar, then looked hard at garry. "and why
      not, mr. Edwards? " "because they are dead. " shalik stiffened and his
      eyes narrowed. "are you telling me miss desmond is dead? "yes, and so are
      the other two. " shalik made an impatient movement which conveyed he
      wasn't interested in the other two. "but what happened? " "she caught a
      bug . . . Lots of dangerous bugs in the jungle, and she died. " shalik got
      to his feet and walked over to the window, turning his back to garry. The
      news shocked him. He disliked strangers knowing that he was capable of
      being shocked. After a few moments, he turned and asked, "how do i know
      you are telling me the truth, mr. Edwards? How did the other two die? "
      "jones was eaten by a crocodile. I don't know what happened to fennel. He
      was probably killed by a zulu. I found the zulu dead with fennel's
      rucksack and the ring. Fennel had stolen the ring and my compass and left
      gaye and me to find our way out of the jungle. I succeeded: gaye didn't. "
      "are you quite sure she is dead? " "i'm sure. " shalik sat down. He wiped
      his damp hands on his handkerchief. He had an important assignment
      involving a million dollars lined up for gaye when sheimportant assignment
      involving a million dollars lined up for gaye when she returned. Now, what
      was he to do? He felt a bitter rage seize him. He would have to start
      another long and difficult search for a woman to replace her, and in the
      meantime, the assignment would fall through. "and the ring? " he said,
      controlling his rage. Garry took a matchbox from his pocket and pushed it
      across the desk to shalik who picked it up, shook the ring out on to the
      blotter and regarded it. Well, at least, this assignment hadn't failed. He
      was suddenly very pleased with himself. By using his brains and these four
      people as his pawns, he had made half a million dollars within the space
      of a few days. He examined the ring closely, then nodded his satisfaction.
      As he put the ring down, he said, "i am sure the operation wasn't easy,
      mr. Edwards. I am very pleased. In fairness to you, i will double your
      fee. Let me see . . . It was nine thousand dollars. I will make it
      eighteen thousand. Is that satisfactory to you? " garry shook his head.
      "nine is enough, " he said curtly. "the less i have of your money, the
      cleaner i will feel. " shalik's eyes snapped, but he shrugged. He opened
      his desk drawer and took out a long envelope which he tossed across the
      desk. Garry picked up the envelope. He didn't bother to check the
      contents. Putting the envelope in his breast pocket, he got up and walked
      to the door. "mr. Edwards . . . " garry paused. "what is it? "i would be
      glad if you would dictate a full report of what happened during the
      operation. I would like to have all the details. My secretary will supply
      you with a tape-recorder. " "what do you want it for . . . To give to the
      police? " garry said. "you have the ring . . . That's all you're getting
      from me, " and he went out, walked past the blonde secretary without
      looking at her and hurried to the elevator, his oneblonde secretary
      without looking at her and hurried to the elevator, his one thought now
      being to get back to toni. Shalik stared at the closed door, thought for a
      moment, then shrugged. Perhaps after all, it was better not to know too
      much about what happened, he decided. Pity about gaye. He knew she had no
      relations. There would be no awkward questions asked. She had come into
      his life, served a useful purpose, and now she had gone. It was a
      nuisance, but no woman was irreplaceable. He picked up the ring and
      examined it. Holding it in his left hand, he reached for his telephone and
      dialled a number. The diamonds were nice, he thought and ran his
      forefinger over the cluster, then started as something of needle sharpness
      cut his finger. He dropped the ring, frowning, and conveyed his bleeding
      finger to his mouth. So the borgia ring still scratched, he thought. The
      poison, of course, would have long dried up: after all the ring was nearly
      four hundred years old. He looked at his finger. Quite a nasty scratch. He
      continued to suck his finger as he listened to the burr-burr-burr of the
      telephone bell, thinking how pleased his client would be to get the ring
      back. The end
